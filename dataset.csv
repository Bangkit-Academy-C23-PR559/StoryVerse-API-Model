1,4 ways to get high-paying writing work do not self-publish.,2/11/2019,Kayla Lee,https://medium.com/writing-cooperative/4-ways-to-get-high-paying-writing-work-dont-self-publish-badfa6b07ae2,"Most creatives do not understand one, simple truth:
Turning what you love into a business involves being good at business.
I write full-time for a living, a luxury I enjoy because I am just as much a business person as a writer. While I learned The Elements of Style, I also learned Million Dollar Consulting (not affiliate links). My business acumen said do not listen to the ""pros"" selling overnight self-publishing success. Not that I do not want to self-publish and I am definitely not condemning it but, without a high number of followers (many thousands) or email subscribers (many thousands), self-publishing is not likely to earn a livable wage. You can build a following and email list, and then self-publish profitably. But the likelihood that you will make money from your first book (immense amount of effort) is extremely low. Even if you are a best-seller in some random category no one has ever heard of, people do not search for keywords they have never heard of. You could invest money into ads for your self-published work, but then, you would likely be far in the red before you start to make money. You would be lucky to break even. Or, you might write a dynamite book on your first try (highly unlikely) and sell the shit out of it without any marketing effort whatsoever (highly unlikely). I asked myself, would a smart business person gamble all that writing time and effort on something so unlikely to pay off?
A better way to make money writing
Here are a few mediums I have used to generate a significant income from my writing. I write or ghostwrite ebooks, blogs, articles, and emails for businesses. I write for IT/tech companies, but you can choose any niche that interests you. I have friends that make money writing for lifestyle companies, yoga studios, medical journals, finance firms, law firms, women's rights organs, etc. I built a six-figure writing company with zero professional writing experience, zero followers, and zero people on an email list using the tools I will share here. I have no affiliation with any of these tools.

LinkedIn Profinder
LinkedIn Profinder is one of my favorite tools for finding quality work. You can find decent-paying gigs with small/medium businesses here. It works by creating a profile and entering the type of work you are looking for (content writing, ghostwriting, etc.). Then, when companies create proposal requests for those types of work, you are notified and can apply for the gig. It is a passive medium, meaning, you wait for requests to come to you. The money I made from LinkedIn Profinder One-off writing/email project for $3k.
Contena
Contena is a job board that aggregates all the writing jobs posted on the web and puts them into one place. You can create alerts for yourself for specific job types like how well they pay, what niche, etc. The money I made from Contena Client 1: more than 0.25 USD per word for more than 6 months. Multiple articles per month. Total earnings are about $10k. Client 2: more than 0.25 USD per word for a few projects sporadically for a year. Total earnings are about $14k.
Sending your own pitch 2X per week
This is by far the best way to make money as a writer. Any time a company sends out an RFP or posts to a job board, thousands of writers see it and apply. If you send a pitch to a company, you are likely the only person pitching. There is much less competition. You need to pitch in bulk. Make it a goal to pitch at least 100 companies per week. Ask to write for their blog. Find companies in industries you are interested in writing about (i.e., fitness/lifestyle, tech startups, women's health, etc.). I wrote this article for salespeople, but writers can use it to learn to send pitches in bulk. The money I made from sending a pitch to 7 regular clients buying multiple articles/ebooks per month. Monthly income varies from $3-6k depending on the number of projects. 1 retainer client at $2k/mo.
Get the cheapest WeWork (or other coworking space) membership
If you join WeWork for $45/month, you have access to their online platform. This platform is full of business connections and leads. I got more clients out of the platform than I got by working in the space. The money I made from WeWork app Retainer for email writing and marketing. Total yearly earnings are about $20k. I have had this client for more than 2 years.If you want to write for a living
You need to be open minded about the types of work you can do to earn a decent wage.

A lot of writers feel bummed when they read about writers who are not as skilled making lots of money. But, if you are a highly skilled writer, you should be gleeful that other, less skilled writers make more than you. That only means you can earn much more.",Kesehatan Mental
2,What Can I Do Without an Eating Disorder?,5/11/2023,Mary-Elizabeth Schurrer,https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs/survivinged/2023/5/what-can-i-do-without-an-eating-disorder,"For most of my life, I was plagued by the question, ""What will I do without an eating disorder?"" It felt unattainable even to imagine an alternate reality in which those obsessions with food, exercise, or body image weren't constantly humming at the forefront of my brain. Each waking moment was a conquest to burn calories or simply avoid them altogether. At the time, it seemed euphoric, but now I can see just how bleak of an existence I forced myself to live. So these days, I ask another question: ""What can I do without an eating disorder?""
Reframing 'What Can I Do Without an Eating Disorder?'
""What will I do?"" is a fear-based question. It makes the assumption that my core human identity revolves around an eating disorder and that I will cease to matter in its absence. I used to believe this legitimately. I built my definition of success and self-worth on how staunchly I maintained the behaviors that were killing me. I ruled this microcosm with an iron fist of control and containment or maybe it ruled me. Either way, I would not allow myself to entertain the notion that life could be meant for something more. Talk about a hopeless situation.
But this is what I love about eating disorder recovery: It's an invitation to rewrite the script I used to follow and reframe the question I used to agonize over. What can I do without an eating disorder? That line of inquiry is more expansive. It creates room for both possibility and curiosity to flourish. It asks me to dream of a future in which the number on a scale or the metrics on a fitness tracker cannot dictate my value. Most of all, it has me wondering, ""What sort of impact or meaning could I tap into if my time wasn't consumed with these eating disorder behaviors?""
There's so much to think about, to learn, to discover, to experiment with, to be interested in.
I Want to Focus on What I Can Do Without an Eating Disorder
I think fear is the enemy of healing. Therefore, I no longer want to fixate on the question, ""What will I do without an eating disorder?"" I am worth more than the calories I burn, the food I consume, the miles I run, or the pounds I weigh. I have more to offer this world than how successful I am at abusing myself. I want to read books, write poetry, or create artwork instead of exercising for hours on end. I want to volunteer time and energy to causes I feel passionate about instead of wasting those resources on compulsive eating disorder rituals.
I want to bask in the colors of a sunset and savor the taste of nourishment on my lips. I want to invest in relationships that matter so much more than a slew of unhealthy habits. I want to be curious, present, and fully alive. So I'll continue asking, ""What can I do without an eating disorder?"" If it takes me a lifetime to find the answer—well, mission accepted. Recovery has no endpoint.

3,Gen Z Is More Aware of Mental Health Than Other Generations,5/10/2023,Mahevash Shaikh,https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs/mentalhealthforthedigitalgeneration/2023/5/gen-z-is-more-aware-of-mental-health-than-other-generations,"	Generation Z (or Gen Z or Zoomers), the generation that succeeds Generation Y (or Gen Y or millennials), is currently more aware of mental health than any other generation. While this sounds like good news, there are negative aspects as well. Let's take a look at Generation Z's relationship to mental health.
Who Is Generation Z?
According to VeryWellMind, 
""Generation Z refers to the generation born roughly between the years 1997 and 2012. They are the first generation to be raised completely with the Internet and smartphones, and have grown up with a very different experience of the world than previous generations. They have grown up in tumultuous times that have included multiple stressors such as 9/11, school shootings, climate change, and political unrest.""1
Gen Z and Mental Health Awareness
In my opinion, millennials helped pave the way for Gen Z's positive attitude toward mental health. Gen Y has contributed a lot towards normalizing conversations around mental health, particularly on social media. Gen Z carried the torch forward by communicating about mental health issues in the physical world. The catch is that Gen Z has a long list of reasons to be mentally unwell. Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company says: 
""A series of consumer surveys and reports conducted by McKinsey indicate stark differences among generations, with Gen Z reporting the least positive life outlook, including lower levels of emotional and social well-being than older generations. One in four Gen Z respondents reported feeling more emotionally distressed (25 percent), almost double the level reported by millennial and Gen X respondents (13 percent each). And the Covid-19 pandemic has only amplified this challenge.""2
Gen Z Is Not Seeking Professional Mental Health Help
With increased mental health awareness, one may conclude that Zoomers are going to therapy more than any other generation. Unfortunately, due to issues like lack of access to behavioral healthcare and poverty, I have seen Zoomers turning to social media apps like TikTok and Reddit for peer support. They are following therapists on Instagram for mental health support instead of consulting them. Research by McKinsey & Company says:
""Almost one in four Gen Zers reported that it is extremely or very challenging to get help during a behavioral-health crisis. This lack of access is very concerning for a generation two to three times more likely to report seeking treatment in the past 12 months for suicidal ideation or attempted suicide, than any other generation.""2
How Can Older Generations Help? 
Many of the issues that Gen Z is dealing with are systemic and cannot be changed by the general public. However, there are two things we can do as individuals to help the mental health of Gen Z.
First, as parents, teachers, older siblings, and friends, we can spend quality time with Zoomers. We must listen to them without any bias or judgment. For example, if a teenager tells you they have depression, do not mock or downplay their self-diagnosis. Keep an open mind, hear them out, and ask them how you can help.
Second, while Gen Z uses social media to stay connected with friends and cope with mental health issues, too much screen time causes and worsens mental health problems. According to McKinsey & Company,
""Studies of young adults and their social media use have shown an inverse relationship between screen time and psychological well-being, with higher utilization associated with poor well-being. Other research indicates the nature of the relationship individuals have with social media can have a greater impact on their mental health than time spent.""3
It is, therefore, crucial to teach Gen Z to self-regulate the amount of time they spend staring at a screen. And just as importantly, we must help them distinguish between real and fake friends and social media accounts and identify and stand up to online bullying and harassment.

4,Fighting the Stigma of Depression,5/3/2023,Rachel Craft,https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs/copingwithdepression/2023/5/fighting-the-stigma-of-depression,"Although our society has come a long way in the treatment and perception of mental illness, there’s no doubt that stigmas surrounding these illnesses are still alive and well. Societal stigma can lead to self-stigma, and both can be very damaging to people with depression. Here we'll discuss common stigmas about depression, why they're problematic, and what you can do to fight them.
Why Stigma Is Dangerous to People with Depression
Due to stigma, depressed people are often seen as “lazy” or “not trying” rather than ill. I once read an article that, to my shock and dismay, asserted that depressed people don’t need medication; they just need to buy a pair of running shoes and get outside more.
On the one hand, it’s understandable that people without depression can’t imagine how debilitating it is. But hearing their misconceptions while you’re suffering from depression can be extremely damaging. It can make you blame yourself for your mental health struggle, thinking it’s the result of a personality flaw rather than a disease. 
Imagine if someone with an ear infection had the same mindset. “This isn’t really a problem. I don’t need antibiotics; I just need to try to be a better person.”
They could “try” until they went deaf, and the infection would still be there. But due to the intangible nature of mental illness, our society struggles to see it for what it is: an illness. 
How to Fight the Stigma of Depression
When I hear people perpetuating myths and stereotypes about depression, I remind myself that it’s an illness, just like an ear infection or fibromyalgia. This reminds me that my condition is not my fault, not a reflection of who I am as a person, and nothing to be ashamed of. 
Seeing my depression as a disease rather than a personality flaw helps it feel less murky and more tangible. Diseases can be treated. I can learn about what causes them and what alleviates them. I can’t change who I am as a person, but I can arm myself with tools to cope with my disease.
Another thing you can do to fight depression stigma is to talk about your mental illness. The more we bottle up our feelings, the more we—and others—see them as something to be ashamed of. Talking openly about depression, on the other hand, helps normalize it.
Of course, talking about depression is easier said than done. It used to be very difficult for me until I started therapy years ago and learned how talking made me feel better. Now, I challenge myself to stay open about my feelings. 
As I’ve grown and learned more about depression stigma, I’ve also become more comfortable speaking up against it. When an acquaintance expressed some misguided opinions on suicide, I gently reminded him that suicide is not the same as euthanasia. When a coworker struggled to understand the difference between depression and laziness, I told him that I have depression and tried to explain what it feels like. 
Did I get through to these people? I don’t know. But I like to think that many people who perpetuate depression stigma have the capacity for compassion and understanding—they just need to learn more about mental illness and the people it affects.

5,How to Survive the Holidays with Anxiety and Depression,11/28/2023,Martha Lueck,https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs/toughtimes/2022/11/how-to-survive-the-holidays-with-anxiety-and-depression,"At this time of the year, I usually look forward to the holidays. But there are some years when my holiday spirit seems nonexistent. So far this holiday season, my anxiety and depression have been getting worse. Here are some ways I noticed that I am struggling with my mental health and what I plan on doing about it this month.
3 Signs I Struggle with Holiday Anxiety and Depression
1.	In the morning, I dread being around people. My anxiety is at its highest when I anticipate what the day will bring. Working in retail around the holidays is stressful. I picture the checkout line going out the door and customers yelling at the employees for not having certain items. While some of the days are hard, they are rarely as difficult as I think they will be. Some days, a lot of customers are pleasant. It's mostly the anticipation that stresses me out.
2.	I sleep a lot during the day. Sleeping feels good until I realize that half of my day is gone. Some days, I plan on going to the gym, writing an article, and playing with my dogs. When I don't do any of those things, it is because I sleep too much. Sometimes sleeping is warranted by exhaustion after work. But when it happens for prolonged periods, it makes it difficult to enjoy my life. Thus, it makes my depression worse.
3.	I count down the days until the holidays are over. While many people count down the days until Christmas, I count down the days until they are over. When this happens, I feel guilty because I don't want to ruin anyone else's holiday spirit. So while they enjoy Christmas caroling, I isolate myself in my room and fall asleep.
4 Things I Will Do to Take Care of Myself This Month
1.	I will set simple goals. Part of the reason I dread the holiday season is that I have too much time to think about what could go wrong. By setting goals, I will spend more time focusing on what to accomplish this month. For instance, I would like to work out, publish stories, and hang out with loved ones three times per week. I am already looking forward to working toward these goals.
2.	I will journal every day. One of the best things about journaling is that it helps me process and solve my issues. By doing it every day, I will see patterns for my triggers and behaviors. I will spend at least 15 minutes journaling every day. I will include positive experiences and moments of gratitude. I will also write about a positive holiday memory.
3.	I will attend therapy sessions every week. I recently started seeing a new therapist. So far, she has been very kind and helpful. She validates my feelings while helping me see things from different perspectives. She helps me set and keep realistic goals. Talking to her every week will help me learn how to manage anxiety and depression symptoms better.
4.	I will meditate with autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) stimuli. When I am stressed out, I enjoy listening to ASMR sounds. Different sounds and triggers stimulate emotions like relaxation and pleasure. Calming sounds like ocean waves and whispers relax me. My favorite ASMR audio includes positive affirmations, as they reduce both anxiety and depression. I will make an ASMR playlist specifically for holiday anxiety and listen to it for at least half an hour every day.

6,"Is My Depression Back, or Is It My Period?",5/5/2020,Meghan Griffith,https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs/recoveringfrommentalillness/2020/5/is-my-depression-back-or-is-it-my-period,"Many people who experience periods also experience depression in the form of mood fluctuations that can range anywhere from frustrating to debilitating. If you're like me and you're in recovery from a mood disorder like depression, these monthly fluctuations can be a real source of fear and hopelessness.
Before I do the math and realize my depressed mood is right on schedule and my period should be arriving any day now, I often get very nervous that I'm experiencing a full-blown depression relapse. I've been doing so much better recently and every month when I start to feel depressed again, I can't help but start to worry that everything is getting seriously bad again. I worry that I'm facing months of depression again when really, this will be over in a day or two.
Validating Period-Related Depression Without Becoming Hopeless
When I first started noticing this pattern of serious depressive symptoms arriving right before my period, I tried to shame them away. I told myself how stupid I was being, that a little hormonal shift could put me back into such a horrible headspace. I told myself it was stupid to be afraid that this depression might be long-lasting this time. I told myself a lot of mean stuff to try to make my period-related depression to go away. Shockingly, that never worked. I've said it before and I'll say it again: shame solves nothing.
Now, I am trying to validate the pain I'm experiencing when it comes to period-related depression without falling into the trap of believing that my depression is back for good, I was never really recovering and everything is hopeless and terrible. This is incredibly hard to do when I'm depressed because my brain automatically goes into a very hopeless mode, but over the years, I have gotten better at gently holding different realities at the same time. It's possible to be genuinely depressed without my major depressive disorder making a full-blown comeback, and it is possible to allow myself to be depressed without giving up on everything.
5 Tips for Coping with Period-Related Depression
1.	Remind yourself it's temporary this time. I know in my experience, my brain resists this knowledge. It tries to scare me by constantly asking ""But what if it's back forever?"" I try to remind myself that if that happens (and that is a big ""if"") then I will deal with it when my depression has lasted more than a few days.
2.	In the meantime, be patient and forgiving. While you wait for your period-related depression to fade, try to give yourself as much patience and forgiveness as possible. I felt so guilty today as I scrolled through social media over and over while my infant son had to entertain himself for most of the day. But I fed him, cuddled him and changed him, and for today, that was enough. You can only do what you can do. Remember that depression really limits your ability to interact with the world around you, and this applies to period-related depression as well.
3.	Try at least one coping mechanism. You don't have to whip out every self-care activity in the book, but you owe it to yourself to try at least one good coping mechanism. If you don't have the energy to color something or go for a walk, try a more low-energy form of self-care, like listening to soothing music or simply sitting in the sun for a little while if that's an option.
4.	Schedule therapy appointments on a schedule that lines up with your period-related depression. If you use therapy to help treat your mental illness, try to schedule appointments so you have a chance to talk to your therapist when you're experiencing period-related depression. Many of us see our therapists once every two weeks, so try to make sure the schedule works so that you have an appointment a few days before your period is supposed to start each month.
5.	Talk to your doctor or therapist about premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). If your period-related depression has a serious impact on your life, you may want to speak to your doctor or therapist about premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). This is a disorder recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and it is characterized by severe depression, anxiety, or irritability in the week or two before your period that has a significant impact on your functioning or quality of life.

7,Anxiety and Bipolar: What It's Like to Have Both?,10/17/2018,Hannah Blum,https://www.healthyplace.com/living-with-bipolar-blog/2018/10/anxiety-and-bipolar-what-its-like-to-have-both,"Anxiety, when you live with bipolar II disorder, accentuates feelings of extreme worry and emphasizes our already existing insecurities. Acknowledging the triggers of anxiety and discussing how it makes those of us with bipolar disorder feel is an essential part of managing our mental health.
Anxiety Triggers When You Live with Bipolar II Disorder
In my experience living with bipolar II disorder, stress and periods of uncertainty trigger my anxiety. It affects my work, relationships and even friendships, periodically.
When I was in school, elementary through college, anxiety was ever-present (read more about school anxiety). I struggled academically, and the pressure to follow the standard curriculum of academics made me feel inadequate. I could be doing an assignment and anxiety would make me physically ill; to the point that I had to be excused from the classroom. Then there were exams which would trigger bouts of severe anxiety. In the days before taking an exam, I could not sleep or eat. Depressive episodes would suddenly appear that left me isolated in my room. It didn't matter how much I studied before a test; the emotional extremes would prevent me from being able to focus on the material.
What Anxiety Feels Like When You Have Bipolar II
Anxiety makes those of us with bipolar II feel alone. It can keep us from doing things that many people do not consider hard, such as grocery shopping. It feels like a roadblock that prevents me from accomplishing my goals. Anxiety emphasizes my fears of failure and disappointment which leads to self-doubt. It acts like a bully inside my head and makes me question everything from what I say to what I wear. The overthinking and over-analyzing elements of a situation are exhausting and unhealthy.
Thoughts and questions race through my mind at a higher speed. It feels like I have to accomplish everything all at once and improve myself overnight, which is impossible. However, over time and with experience, I have realized the power of ""letting go"". Self-help books, such as, ""You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Starting Living an Awesome Life"" by Jen Sincero, have helped me cope with anxiety.
I have no control over the way people perceive me and the outcome of certain situations. For me, that's difficult to accept, but necessary for living a good life with bipolar II disorder. Prioritizing projects and focusing on one realistic goal at a time makes me feel less anxious as well.
Anxiety can be debilitating for many of us living with bipolar II disorder, but with hard work and patience, it can be less extreme. We cannot erase anxiety from our lives with bipolar, but we can learn how to manage it. Opening up about the way it makes us feel and sharing different anxiety coping skills and ways of dealing with those extreme emotions is beneficial for all of us living with bipolar disorder.

8,Self-Care in 30 Seconds or Less,3/31/2021,George Abitante,https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs/treatinganxiety/2021/3/self-care-in-30-seconds-or-less,"	I've learned how to self-care in 30 seconds or less because the last few months have been really hectic for me. I've been getting up to speed on several projects in my Ph.D. program, learning new statistical techniques, keeping up with coursework, and it's been really tough to build in time to focus on my own wellbeing. For me, it's been difficult having most of my work time at home because I really like working in a designated workspace and just using my home as a place to relax, so having my work and relaxation spaces completely overlap has made it even more difficult to create a space for self-care for 30 seconds or any other length of time.
This combination of work responsibilities and little delineation between work and relaxation has left me feeling like I don't get to relax much, even though I'm able to do activities I enjoy. My solution so far has been to build moments of relaxation into my workday so that I can rejuvenate myself regularly instead of trying to do it all at once at the end of the day.
I've found it really helpful to find activities that I consider calming and rejuvenating that can also be completed within 30 seconds or so. This allows me to stay engaged in my workday while also creating moments to build myself up, even on the busiest days. So today, I'd like to share with you what that process has been like and give a few tips about how you can incorporate 30 seconds or less of self-care into your day. 
30 Second Self-Care at Work
My journey towards 30-second-or-less self-care sessions began when I noticed that I wasn't regularly getting to the big things I wanted to be doing to take care of myself. I was struggling to incorporate some structured self-care activities into my days that I could do on a regular basis on a standard schedule. Unfortunately, my schedule varies a fair bit from week to week, so having a regular time to exercise or do other time-intensive activities was really hard for me to find.
I kept trying to commit to more than I could realistically do, and this felt like a perpetual wheel of setting a schedule and then not sticking to it. What I realized eventually was that I needed to find something more manageable that I could do at a regular time even when my schedule changed, and this prompted me to commit to something simple but enjoyable: five deep breaths.
This may sound a bit silly, but for me, taking just a few deep breaths does so much to help me reset and recharge, even when I'm having a tough day. So I set a daily reminder for myself at noon to take five deep breaths, and I noticed pretty quickly that this was an activity I could actually do on a regular basis and was simple enough that I could do it regardless of what else was going on. Whether I was in class, talking in a meeting, or working on a project, I could always take those five deep breaths without it interrupting what I was doing.
For me, taking those five deep breaths was more about giving myself a structured, intentional couple of moments of my day that I knew were focused on cultivating my health and wellness. Even though it wasn't a lot of time, it gave me a sense of calm and accomplishment and also made it easier for me to use deep breathing at other times when something stressful came up.
I am now starting to add to this schedule, incorporating more planned deep breathing into the morning and afternoon, and I'm excited to see how building on this practice will benefit me. Below, I share a few ideas that can help you get started with your own 30-second-or-less self-care routine.
Creating your 30-Second Self-Care Routine
1.	Identify your needs. The process I described above came about because I realized I wanted more structure in my day and needed an activity that I could do easily even when my schedule switched up on me. What you want out of your self-care routine may be completely different from mine, so the type of activity you do may vary. So, to start, think about what you actually want to achieve with your self-care activity, and this will shape how you actually implement it. 
2.	Commit. Realistically assessing how reliably you can do your self-care activity is a really important part of the process. My earlier attempts left me feeling inept and tired because I wasn't able to do them as regularly as I wanted, and that ended up draining me more than it contributed to my wellbeing. Make sure the activity you choose is sustainable, and if it turns out to be too much, find a different one or adapt it so that it can be. 
3.	Build. Once you're comfortable with the regular practice you're doing, you can add to it as wanted/needed. In my case, I still want to have more instances of deep breathing during the day, so I'm adding a morning and afternoon reminder to my practice. You might increase how long you engage in your activity, increase how many days a week you do it, or augment it in some other way to improve the benefits you get out of it.

9,Rasanya Bekerja Dengan Depresi,12/20/2018,dhani,https://medium.com/@arman-dhani/rasanya-bekerja-setelah-depresi-72c912e822aa,"Seminggu yang lalu akhirnya saya ke psikolog lagi. Yeaaay. Hehehe. Mungkin buat kalian ini hal yang aneh. Ke psikolog kok senang, tapi bagi saya yang susah sekali ngomong, bicara dan membahas tentang kondisi depresi yang saya alami, bertemu dokter adalah kemewahan yang ngga bisa saya jelaskan.
Kenapa saya ketemu dokter lagi? Jadi ceritanya saya sudah delapan bulan ngga konsultasi atau konseling. Terakhir Saya merasa bahwa ngga perlu konsultasi lagi. Saya sedikit mendingan, trauma interaksi dengan orang, atau menghadapi kerja sehari-hari jadi lebih baik. Intinya sejak 8 bulan lalu saya membaik secara mental. Hanya belakangan saya pelan-pelan kembali ke kondisi cemas, takut, dan mudah panik. Pemicunya karena merasa takut sendirian. Hehehe, agak konyol memang. Sendiri? Lha temen banyak, grup wasap bejibun, temen nongkrong ada, kok merasa sendirian? Saya ngga mau manja, ini mungkin cuma selewat aja.
Saya berusaha meyakinkan diri ini bukan depresi, paling cuma malas. Bukan kecemasan, hanya khawatir biasa. Saya ngga mau mensugesti diri kalau saya ini depresi lagi. Saya kapok ngga bisa kerja, cuma nangis dan diam aja. Saya mau jadi manusia yang sehat, berfungsi normal. Tapi ngga bisa. Susah sekali. Saya nyaris dua minggu tidak bekerja dan hanya bisa terbaring di kamar. Menangis, ngga makan, dan susah tidur. Saya juga punya kecenderungan ngga mau ngerepotin orang. Kalau saya cerita depresi saya muncul lagi, teman-teman saya akan khawatir dan mereka akan ekstra direpotkan dengan perasaan-perasaan saya yang kadang ngga masuk akal. Untuk itu supaya ngga curiga kalau saya kenapa-kenapa ya buka media sosial. Buka instagram lalu pamer-pamer.
Lho kok depresi malah pamer? Entah mengapa saya punya dorongan aneh. Jika saya buka media sosial atau memposting kondisi sendiri tentu akan jadi aneh. Semacam minta dikasihani. Jadi saya berusaha mensugesti diri bahwa saya sedang baik-baik saja. Memposting foto makanan dari berbulan-bulan lalu, foto sepatu, atau bahkan pemandangan. Tapi kali ini udah ngga tahan lagi. Ini subuh dan saya bingung mau cerita pada siapa dan kepala saya seperti ditaruh di balok es yang keras. Seluruh pundah saya menegang dan rasanya seperti sedang memikul beras bulog yang kalau dimasak rasanya ngga enak.
Orang tentu ngga akan mengira bahwa saya sedang cemas atau takut. Cemas kok pamer jordan, takut kok pamer sepatu? Intinya orang akan berpikir sebaliknya dengan apa yang saya alami. Mungkin cuma itu satu-satunya cara agar mereka tak khawatir atau tak peduli. Kondisi saya memburuk sejak pacar saya ke Taiwan. Kami berpisah dan lumayan berat buat saya untuk ngga sama dia. Selama ini saya selalu mengandalkan dia untuk bisa berfungsi sehari-hari. Dulunya saya pikir kalau kami pisah, saya akan baik-baik saja. Nyatanya tidak. Kondisi saya terus memburuk dan memburuk. Saya jadi kurang berinteraksi bersama teman. Jarang main, jarang wasap, jarang membalas pesan, menghabiskan banyak waktu di media sosial, dan yang paling buruk bisa berhari-hari tidak keluar kamar. Kadang nangis, kadang diem aja kaya mayat. Kondisi ini benar-benar bikin saya ngga bisa fungsi normal.
Untungnya saya punya kantor dengan jam kerja fleksibel. Tapi ya ngga enak juga dua minggu kerjanya minimal, berantakan dan ngga bagus. Saya jadi mikir, gimana perusahaan lain memperlakukan karyawan mereka yang mempunyai gangguan kesehatan mental? Apakah mereka akan memberikan toleransi serupa atau akan langsung kasih SP3?
Di kantor saya juga diberi kemudahan biaya konseling psikologis. Sesuatu yang tak pernah saya temukan sebelumnya. Selama ini belum ada asuransi yang mengover kesehatan mental. Jadi merasa beruntung juga. Meski kadang suka ngga enak, karena punya bos dan rekan kerja yang demikian baik. Saya ngga bisa cerita tentang konseling yang saya lakukan. Hanya saja, belakangan durasi tidur saya makin pendek dan susah tidur di atas jam 3 pagi. Saya ngga tahu cara mengatasinya. Mungkin saya perlu minum obat atau mungkin harus olahraga lagi. Malam ini saya susah tidur lagi. Oh iya, jika kamu mengalami hal yang serupa, merasa takut, cemas, dan ngga berharga. Jangan takut. Kamu ngga sendirian. Kita sama-sama coba hadapi ini. Kamu dengan caramu, saya dengan entah apa. Yang jelas kamu dan saya sama-sama berharga. Hehe. gitu.

10,"Pengalaman, Kesehatan Mental dan Hewan Peliharaan",12/12/2019,Tiara Afwani,https://medium.com/@tiaraafwani/kesehatan-mental-1be1e8dd08ca,"Disclaimer: saya bukan ahli di bidang psikologis, sekedar berbagi pengalaman pribadi.
Dulu saya terheran-heran dengan orang-orang yang tinggal bersama hewan peliharaan di rumahnya (terutama hewan berbulu). Saya tidak benci hewan, sekedar biasa-biasa saja. Yang saya bayangkan bulu berterbangan dan kotoran dimana-mana. Apalagi sampai dicium-cium dan tidur di kasur yang sama. Pandangan saya berubah setelah (tidak direncanakan) saya memilihara seekor kelinci.
Bermula dari kondisi mental saya yang saat itu sedang buruk dan merasa kesepian. Perasaan sedih sering menghampiri, ditambah kesepian yang membuat tangis saya menjadi-jadi. Dalam pikiran saat itu, saya tidak mempercayai manusia-manusia lain.
Pada suatu hari saya menghadiri family gathering di sebuah kawasan pariwisata di luar kota. Dan saya jatuh hati dengan seekor kelinci yang paling lincah diantara teman-temannya. Diajak pulanglah dia, dan dinamakan Cimol. (tidak disarankan membawa hewan peliharaan tanpa persiapan terlebih dulu). “Asyik punya teman saat sedih”, begitu pikirku.
Diluar dugaan, Cimol ini seperti tahu saat saya sedih Dia menghampiri. Pikiran-pikiran buruk saya teralihkan oleh sentuhan kaki mungilnya. Saya mengusap-usap kepala Cimol sampai giginya bergemeletuk sebagai tanda suka.
Saya yang semula sama sekali tidak memperhatikan diri sendiri dan lebih banyak tidur untuk lari dari kenyataan, perlahan dipaksa untuk bangun pagi. Cimol mengetuk-ngetuk pintu kamar, meminta sarapan. Suara ketukannya yang cukup berisik memaksa saya bangun karena khawatir orang lain terganggu. Jadilah saya tidak tidur lagi. Saya sadar dengan kewajiban menyiapkan makanannya 3 kali sehari, jadilah saya mulai sadar waktu pagi, siang, dan malam setiap harinya.
Perlahan hari saya tidak monoton. Saya memberanikan diri menyalakan gawai yang sudah cukup lama tidak aktif. Untuk apa? sekedar memesan online persedian makanan Cimol yang hampir habis atau mencari tahu cara memilihara kelinci. Dari situ saya mulai membalas beberapa pesan teman dan sepupu saya yang menanyakan kabar. Meski jawaban saya singkat, setidaknya sudah ada kabar. Meski setengah hari saya masih bertanya, apakah siap untuk berhubungan sosial dengan manusia lain.
Saya melihat-lihat komunitas penghobi kelinci di internet, perlahan saya merasa menemukan tempat baru dan menemukan manusia lain yang memiliki kesamaan dengan saya. Sekarang saya menjadi orang yang dulu saya herankan memilihara hewan dirumah. Merasa disayangi saat Cimol menjilat-jilat kaki, tangan, bahkan leher saya. Terima kasih Cimol yang perlahan mewarnai hidup saya. I love you more then the words can say.

11,Mengurangi Instagram Demi Kesehatan Mentalku,10/31/2017,Annisa Widi Astuty,https://medium.com/@annisawidiastuty/mengurangi-instagram-demi-kesehatan-mentalku-7c5a7e9459b,"	Aku pengguna Instagram kira-kira sejak awal berdirinya aplikasi berbagi ini. Sejak saat itu hingga tahun-tahun terakhir, Instagram mengalami banyak perubahan. Fitur Instagram kian canggih. Kini Instagram telah digunakan untuk berbagai kepentingan.
Ada yang beken lewat Instagram dengan menjadi selebgram, ada juga yang rintisan usahanya terbantu oleh keberadaan Instagram. Beberapa orang juga memanfaatkan aplikasi ini untuk menunjukkan bakat fotografi, tidak terkecuali selebritis. Belakangan ini, aku membuat keputusan yang cukup berat. Setelah berhari-hari berkontemplasi, akhirnya aku putuskan untuk mengurangi penggunaan Instagram. Hebatnya, aku merasakan banyak perubahan yang sangat berarti. Aku hanya belajar mengurangi, tidak benar-benar menjauhi karena aku merasa banyak peluang positif dan inspirasi yang bisa kutemukan di home Instagram.
	Berhenti ber-Instagram bagi orang yang cukup kecanduan sepertiku bukanlah hal yang mudah. Beberapa kali sejak keputusanku, aku sesekali masih login dan melihat aktivitas beberapa orang teman tanpa menunjukkan tanda-tanda kehidupan. Biasanya, aku sangat aktif memberikan love maupun berkomentar pada unggahan akun yang aku ikuti. Menjadi pengguna pasif membuatku agak gatal tetapi aku berusaha menahan rasa ingin berinteraksiku. Kenapa aku akhirnya bisa menahan diri? Awalnya aku sudah berdeklarasi kepada pengikutku. Aku mendeklarasikan keinginanku untuk mengurangi penggunaan Instagram. Aku menyampaikan niatanku ini lewat instastory dan post foto yang terakhir kuunggah. Bukan bermaksud cari perhatian dengan berdeklarasi demikian. Maksudku adalah meminta dukungan dan bantuan pengikutku kalau saja suatu ketika aku tiba-tiba muncul lagi di Instagram dan melupakan tekadku. Aku meminta bantuan pada mereka untuk mengingatkan jika aku masih ngeyel berkeliaran di Instagram.
Tidak hanya karena alasan itu aku berdeklarasi. Alasan lainnya adalah sebagai pengingat bahwa aku pernah berkata demikian sehingga aku lebih bisa mengontrol diri. Kontrol diri sangat kubutuhkan untuk menghindari cemoohan “Halah, sok-sokan nulis begini ternyata masih nongol aje lu di Instagram. Cih.” atau “Omong kosong nulis begini nggak taunya masih nongol aja ni orang. Caper banget deh jadi orang.”
Bukankah kita tidak pernah tahu isi hati orang? Akan tetapi, bukankah lebih baik mencegah pemikiran terburuk yang mungkin terjadi itu agar tidak benar-benar terjadi?
Lalu, apa sebenarnya yang membuatku mengambil keputusan ini? Sebenarnya, aku merasa waktuku banyak tersita dengan bermain Instagram. Aku akui kontrol diriku begitu kurang. Sedikit-sedikit pasti ngecek Instagram. Kalau tidak ada notifikasi, bawaannya ingin melakukan sesuatu supaya tetap ada yang dilihat saat berkunjung ke Instagram. Beberapa cara yang biasa kulakukan adalah update instastoryatau mengunggah post baru.
Sayangnya, perbuatanku ini membuatku merasa yang namanya sindrom Fear of Missing Out. Takut ketinggalan informasi membuatku secara tidak sadar merasa resah dengan aktivitas di Instagram. Aku selalu ingin tahu kabar terbaru di luar sana, kabar mengenai teman-temanku, seperti tidak ingin ketinggalan obrolan seru mereka di media sosial. Selain itu, terkadang aku memikirkan kemungkinan komentar yang akan kudapatkan dengan post tertentu. Pemikiran atas kemungkinan ini membuatku rutin mengecek Instagram. Ketiadaan notifikasi terkadang membuatku berusaha untuk membuat pancingan lain agar mendapatkan respon sesuai yang kuharapkan.
Berulang kali melakukan hal seperti itu membuatku merasa tidak nyaman. Aku merasa hidupku terlalu terhisap oleh dunia Instagram. Sejak ada instastory, sedikit-sedikit rasanya ingin update kegiatan. Rasanya aku selalu ingin orang lain melihat sesuatu yang menurutku lucu, unik, atau menghibur. Rasanya aku ingin membagi perasaanku pada orang lain terus-menerus.
Semakin ke sini, aku semakin berkontemplasi lebih giat. Seminggu lebih tanpa aktivitas di Instagram, aku merasa jauh lebih baik. Bangun tidur aku tidak lagi kepikiran notifikasi apa yang sekiranya kudapatkan. Saat pergi ke suatu tempat aku tidak lagi kepikiran untuk memasukkannya ke dalam instastory. Aku jadi merasa lebih bisa menikmati proses hidupku. Aku merasa lebih here and now.
Kenapa aku tidak berhenti ber-Instagram? Jawabannya karena Instagram tidak selamanya buruk. Banyak hal positif yang terkadang bisa menjadi motivasi bagiku. Beberapa orang yang aku ikuti di Instagram adalah tokoh inspiratif. Aku merasa terbantu dengan unggahan mereka.
Meninggalkan Instagram memang tidak mudah, aku di sini belajar mengurangi penggunaannya. Segala sesuatu yang berlebihan memang tidak pernah baik. Selalu ada hikmah dibalik hal-hal negatif, termasuk Instagram, yang digadang-gadang merupakan media sosial paling tidak baik untuk kesehatan mental seseorang.

12,Kami ODGJ/ODMK. Apa Kami Tidak Pantas Dicintai Dengan Layak?,4/18/2021,Ann Putri,https://medium.com/@annputri/kami-odgj-odmk-apa-kami-tidak-pantas-dicintai-dengan-layak-af9771d18481,"	Saya ODGJ. Lebih tepatnya depresi berat dengan gangguan cemas menengah tapi psikiater-psikiater (ya, saya beberapa kali ganti psikiater karena pindah-pindah) menduga saya bipolar. Menuliskan kalimat ini sebenarnya sangat sulit karena saya tahu tulisan ini bisa digunakan untuk menghakimi atau bahkan mengucilkan saya. Tapi saya pikir perlu menuliskan ini sebagai konteks besar dan sebagai pengingat bahwa kami 1) betul-betul ada; 2) manusia juga, bukan monster yang tak pantas ditemani apalagi disayang sampai akhir hayat.
Ada banyak hal yang mengganggu saya, tapi ada satu yang mencuat. Bagaimana masyarakat kita punya pandangan yang sangat terdistorsi terhadap orang dengan gangguan jiwa (ODGJ) dan orang dengan masalah kejiwaan (ODMK).
Menengok ke belakang dan membandingkannya dengan masa sekarang membuat saya bersyukur saya hidup di zaman ini. Memang kadang rasanya berat dan susah, tapi setidaknya kita bisa hidup lama dan lebih mudah dibanding buyut kita.
Rasa bersyukur saya terutama di bidang kejiwaan. Masyarakat nampaknya mulai sadar akan masalah kejiwaan. Support group seperti Komunitas Peduli Skizofrenia Indonesia dan Bipolar Care Indonesia cukup ramai diisi oleh penderita dan pengampu mereka. Ada komunitas kejiwaan yang fokus ke pencegahan bunuh diri seperti Into The Light ID, dan saban hari di Facebook, Twitter, Instagram pasti ada postingan viral tentang kesehatan mental dari masyarakat umum dan nakes.
Internet, terutama media sosial, membuat saya dan banyak penderita lainnya merasa tidak sendirian. Di tempat virtual ini (harapannya) kami bisa membicarakan masalah kami dengan bebas tanpa penghakiman dan stigma langsung. Kami tidak malu untuk terbuka bahwa kami punya masalah A-Z karena kami tahu di luar sana ada yang punya masalah serupa. Kami bisa memeluk virtual satu sama lain, meyakinkan kalau masalah apapun itu akan selesai. Saking seringnya saya menemui orang-orang bernasib sama, saya pikir media sosial bisa disebut panti rehab sambil terkekeh.
Tapi media sosial yang sama juga bisa menjadi bumerang bagi kami. Status-status mengeluh soal masalah hidup, keinginan mengakhiri diri, postingan self-harm, atau bahkan hal kecil saja yang nampaknya biasa-biasa saja (sebagai gambaran, saya takut setengah mati sama balon) bisa menjadi pemicu untuk penyakit kami.
Maklum, media sosial rawan membuat kita terjebak dalam gelembung. Kadang kita terlalu nyaman dengan gelembung ini sampai kita lupa bahwa kita sebetulnya tinggal dalam satu ruang umum yang bisa dilihat, dikomentari, dan dibagikan oleh orang banyak. Akibatnya kita sering lupa bahwa perkataan yang buat sebagian orang bisa menjadi pemacu, malah menjadi pemicu bagi yang lain.
Salah satu kalimat yang sudah pasti membuat saya terusik adalah pernyataan orang-orang (yang saya anggap — bisa saja salah — tidak punya masalah seperti kami) tentang kami. Kalimat itu salah satunya “benarkan dulu diri kamu sebelum memulai hubungan serius” atau “selesaikan dulu masalahmu, berdamai dengan dirimu, baru bikin komitmen serius”. Atau yang lebih eksplisit lagi, “ODGJ yang tidak punya keinginan untuk sembuh dan malah menggunakan penyakitnya sebagai alasan untuk berbuat tai tidak usah pacaran.” Balasan-balasannya banyak yang mendukung pernyataan ini, beberapa malah membeberkan kelakuan ODGJ/ODMK ketika mereka sedang di titik terburuk (self-harm, manipulatif, menggunakan taktik bunuh diri untuk mendapatkan apa yang mereka mau, gaslighting, ghosting, dll).
Saya paham bahwa hal-hal ini sangat melelahkan dan bahkan bisa sangat traumatis. Saya pernah berada di dua posisi ini: sebagai yang menerima kelakuan terburuk ODGJ/ODMK dan yang melakukannya. Saya tidak bangga akan dua hal tersebut dan saya sangat menyesali perbuatan saya. Teman-teman ODGJ/ODMK juga mengatakan hal yang sama: mereka selalu menyesali apa yang mereka perbuat ketika kumat.
Sayangnya setiap kami kumat seringkali kami merasa orang-orang ada untuk menyudutkan, meninggalkan, atau membahayakan kami. Sehingga kami bersikap defensif untuk melindungi diri. Sikap defensif kami bisa membingungkan, menyebalkan, tidak masuk akal. Kadang malah bisa membahayakan kamu. Bagimu hal ini tidak masuk akal, tapi bagi kami ini masuk akal. Penyakit ini membuat kita melihat satu hal yang sama dengan persepsi yang berbeda. Tapi apa ini berarti kami tidak pantas untuk dipahami dan dicintai? Karena sulit menghadapi kami?
Bagi kami kalimat-kalimat di atas menyudutkan dan mengasingkan kami. Beberapa dari kami bisa mengabaikannya, tapi tak sedikit yang benar-benar terpengaruh olehnya. Sebagian teman saya yang ODGJ/ODMK pesimis akan prospek hubungan romantik dan memilih untuk jomblo seumur hidup. Semua takut akan dianggap beban oleh pasangan, termasuk saya.
Namun kami lebih dari sekedar penyakit kami. Kami lebih dari sekedar episode buruk kami. Kami juga manusia, sama seperti kalian. Kami mungkin tidak bisa 100 persen sehat, tapi kami bisa produktif dan berdaya selama kalian memberikan kami kesempatan untuk itu.
Walau begitu, kami paham kalau kalian para pendamping atau teman sudah di titik tidak kuat. Kalian sudah berulang kali mengajak sang ODGJ/ODMK berobat, tapi mereka menolak terus. Atau justru kalian tidak punya akses bantuan yang memadai. Kalian ingin istirahat. Kalian ingin barang satu detik saja bisa lepas dari kami. Kalau memang tidak kuat, carilah bantuan. Teman, minimal. Pergi ke psikolog juga sangat membantu. Tapi kalau memang sudah di titik nadir, terutama kalau konteks hubungan adalah romantik, sebaiknya putus saja.
Kadang kita harus nrimo bahwa ada orang-orang yang memang tidak ditakdirkan untuk satu sama lain. Banyak hubungan saya kandas karena ternyata kami tidak cocok. Di pacar pertama, ternyata jadwal kami jarang cocok dan dia tidak bisa memenuhi kebutuhan emosional saya. Di pacar kedua, ternyata kami berdua memiliki masalah kejiwaan yang malah memperparah kondisi kami berdua. Akhirnya demi kebaikan kami berdua, kami putus. Sekarang dia sudah menikah, sementara saya berpacaran dengan laki-laki lain yang mau menerima dan tumbuh dengan saya.
Ini baru hubungan romantik. Belum hubungan platonik alias pertemanan yang kadang komitmennya tidak sekuat hubungan romantik. Saya sudah lupa hitungan berapa pertemanan yang putus karena permasalahan kejiwaan saya atau karena jalan kami sudah berbeda jauh.
Ada banyak alasan kenapa orang-orang memilih untuk berkomitmen. Tak sedikit ODGJ/ODMK yang mencari pacar untuk menutupi kekosongan hati. Saya salah satunya. Kesepian ini membuat saya mencari hubungan dekat yang kalau bisa tahan bertahun-tahun: kadang saya beruntung, kadang juga saya buntung karena sakitnya sampai meninggalkan trauma.
Jujur, rasanya seperti judi. Adiktif, bikin sakit, tapi saya mau terus. Karena bagi saya lebih baik punya pasangan daripada sendirian. Saya pikir sentimen yang sama juga dibagikan oleh ODGJ/ODMK lainnya.
Bukan kebetulan pertanyaan favorit psikolog dan psikiater adalah “sudah punya pacar/pasangan?”. Saya pikir ini karena mereka tahu pasangan yang dianggap paling bisa mengerti perasaan kita. Penyakit kejiwaan punya stigma yang sangat berat, sehingga hanya pada pasangan dimana kita (harapannya) punya posisi dan komitmen setara, bisa secara terbuka mengekspos sisi terburuk kita. Tentu dengan harapan kita tetap diterima dan disayang.
Berhadapan dengan ODMK/ODGJ itu sangat melelahkan. Saya harap kalian yang tidak punya masalah kejiwaan bisa paham hal ini sebelum masuk ke hubungan intim dengan kami. Kalian juga manusia biasa, bukan pahlawan super yang punya kekuatan untuk “tahan” 24/7 di samping kami. Bahkan di pasangan sehat saja hal ini bisa sangat melelahkan karena tidak ada “me time” dan batasan antar individu yang membuat kita bisa terus waras.
Terapi memang sangat penting agar ODMK/ODGJ bisa berfungsi dengan baik. Tapi menyuruh kami terapi bukan hal yang mudah. Kadang kami tidak sadar kalau kami sakit. Kadang juga kami kebingungan atau bahkan takut, tidak tahu harus mulai dari mana. Mencari psikolog dan psikiater yang cocok bisa jadi perjalanan yang sulit. Belum lagi harga terapi di negara ini sangat mahal. Sebagai gambaran, sebulan saya bisa mengeluarkan hampir 2 juta untuk terapi dan obat. Teman-teman saya bahkan ada yang habis 5 juta sebulan. Kita harus bersyukur BPJS mengkover penyakit kejiwaan, tapi bisa jadi di masa depan penyakit kejiwaan tidak lagi dikover, meninggalkan kami tanpa obat-obatan penting.
Sekali lagi saya mau mengingatkan kalau kamu hanya manusia biasa. Kalau memang kamu tidak kuat, bahkan setelah mencari bantuan kemana-mana, sebaiknya keluar saja. Tapi apa perlu setelah putus hubungan kamu menuliskan postingan merendahkan soal kami, soal kelakuan terburuk kami ketika kami kumat di forum publik yang bisa ditelan mentah-mentah oleh orang awam? Yang bisa memperburuk stigma terhadap kami? Yang justru semakin mengasingkan kami? Yang membuat sebagian dari kami merasa tidak pantas punya pasangan dan sebaiknya meninggal sendirian saja?
Berhubungan dengan ODMK/ODGJ memang sangat melelahkan. Pahami hal ini sebelum masuk ke dalam hubungan bersama kami. Kami tidak selalu logis, kami bisa tidak bangun dari kasur berhari-hari, mood kami bisa turun mendadak, kami bisa tidak fungsional seperti manusia normal, dan kami bisa kumat bahkan setelah bertahun-tahun terapi. Tidak ada kata “sembuh 100%” dalam kasus-kasus kami. Tapi kami bisa terus tumbuh dan berdaya asal kamu bersedia untuk terus membimbing dan mengerti kami. Bahwa kami sebetulnya juga sama seperti kamu, manusia yang tidak sempurna. Dan sama seperti kamu, ketidaksempurnaan kami bukanlah alasan bagi kamu, bagi masyarakat, untuk memalingkan wajah dari kami.

13,Satu Minggu Tanpa Instagram,8/13/2017,Dzikrina Iffa,https://medium.com/@dzkrn/sebagai-generasi-milenial-media-sosial-sangatlah-mempengaruhi-hidup-saya-ddbee3ee3396,"	Sebagai generasi milenial, media sosial sangatlah mempengaruhi hidup saya. Bahkan bisa dikatakan media sosial memakan lebih dari separuh waktu saya dalam satu hari. Media sosial pertama yang saya aktif di dalamnya adalah facebook, kemudian twitter, lalu pindah ke instagram, snapchat, path, dan seterusnya. Setiap ada media sosial yang baru muncul, seperti ada sebuah keharusan bagi saya untuk join. Tujuannya macam-macam, biar tidak dikata ketinggalan zaman, biar terlihat gaul, agar selalu up to date, dan sebagainya. Setelah dipikir-pikir, tujuan saya bermedia sosial sangat menyimpang dari ‘tujuan awal’ media sosial. Seharusnya media sosial adalah media supaya kita dapat terhubung dengan teman dan orang lain, bahkan orang yang ada di belahan dunia lain.
Dengan keaktifan saya di media sosial, akhirnya seperti timbul ketergantungan pada media sosial tersebut. Hal apapun dibagikan di facebook, pikiran-pikiran yang sedang terlintas?—?non faedah?— langsung di-tweet, foto-foto liburan yang estetik langsung diedit sedikit lalu di posting di instagram, peristiwa yang sedang terjadi langsung direkam lalu dimasukkan ke snapchat, bahkan musik yg sedang kita dengarkan, film yg sedang ditonton, atau kita sedang tidur atau bangun pun bisa dishare lewat path. Apakah generasi saya menikmati kehidupan tanpa privasi seperti itu? Kalau ditanya begitu, memang tergantung pribadi masing-masing, bagaimana individu menggunakan media sosial. Tetapi, bukankah fitur-fitur yg ada di media sosial mengikuti demand penggunanya?
Tentu, saya terpikirkan hal ini baru-baru saja. Karena, jujur saja saya juga sempat larut menikmatinya. Ketika marak pemberitaan remaja bunuh diri, artis memakai narkoba, dan segala ke-tidak-beres-an di negeri ini, saya?—?yang kebetulan sedang menempuh studi psikologi?—?jadi bertanya-tanya apakah Indonesia sedang darurat kesehatan mental? Sebagai mahasiswa, tentu beban saya hanya seputar kuliah, organisasi, kangen orangtua(hehe), dan sebagainya yang bisa dikatakan sebenernya ngga berat-berat amat. Tapi kenapa saya sering merasa stress, ya? Apalagi ketika malam-malam setelah selesai tugas, mau tidur sambil nge-scroll timeline media sosial. Bukannya menyegarkan pikiran, kok rasanya malah semakin menambah beban?
Akhirnya dari seminggu kemarin saya putuskan untuk tidak membuka instagram. Kenapa hanya(baru) instagram? Karena seiring berkembangnya waktu, instagram selalu menambahkan fitur-fitur menarik yang kemudian menanggalakan fungsi media sosial lainnya. Terbukti dari tenggelamnya media sosial lain, tergantikan oleh instagram. Pokoknya lengkap banget lah di instagram. Dan setelah kurang lebih seminggu ini rasanya sangat amat ploooong. Rasanya seperti sebagaian beban terangkat, stress reliever.
Dan ya benar saja, sehari-hari melihat setiap menit kehidupan orang lain dengan fitur instastory nya instagram, setiap hari pasti ada teman posting liburan ke tempat yang amazing, atau makan di restoran mewah, dan lain-lain yang intinya mah saya iri aja hehe. Maksudnya, stress bgt ngga sih, setiap hari lihat temen punya sesuatu yg ga kita punya, pergi liburan ke luar negeri yg kita lihatnya ‘wow gampang bgt sih dia ke luar negeri kaya setiap bulan’ padahal kita cm asumsi aja kan, terus juga lihat temen yang menjalani kehidupan yg purrrfect ngga seperti kita, dan sebagainya dan sebagainya. Tanpa saya sadari, saya hanya sibuk mendokumentasikan momen-momen saya(dalam bentuk apapun) dan juga menjadi penonton kehidupan orang lain. Akibatnya sebaik apapun momen yang saya tunjukkan di postingan saya, saya tidak benar-benar menikmati momen tersebut. Bahkan yg katanya quality time dengan sahabat atau keliarga pun, nyatanya ngga begitu berkualitas krn saya sibuk nge-story dan membalas pesan. Poin yang saya dapat adalah bahwa stress yg saya alami ya karena itu, penyakit-penyakit hati yang tertimbun. Dan stress juga merupakan penyakit mental, kan? Kalau ngga ditangani bisa jadi depresi dan akibatnya bisa-bisa muncul di berita, kalau ngga bunuh diri, ya narkoba. Naudzubillahimindzalik.
Setelah merenungi hal-hal di atas, saya jadi berjanji pd diri saya sendiri untuk tidak gampang berbagi di media sosial, selain krn privasi, jg meminimalisir supaya org lain ga iri sm kehidupan saya. Hahahahaha padahal mah apa yang mau di-iri-in? Intinya adalah kembali pd tujuan awal bermedia sosial: terhubung sm orang lain. Dengan terhubung bukan berarti semuanya dipamerkan, kan? Alih-alih membagi setiap menit kehidupan kita, waktu kita bisa digunakan untuk hal-hal produktif seperti menulis hal yang sok faedah kaya gini hehe.
So, be smart dalam bermedia sosial, jangan sampai ketergantungan. Jangan hanya menjaga kesehatan fisik, kesehatan mental juga sama pentingnya. Kalau kamu merasakan stress, segera cari penyebabnya dan atasi, yaa! Jangan takut mencari bantuan apabila kamu memerlukannya.

14,Kalau Kamu Selalu Khawatir,7/3/2019,Adjie Santosoputro,https://medium.com/@adjiesantosoputro/kalau-kamu-selalu-khawatir-da18a7958845,"Sekitar sepuluh tahun yang lalu, beberapa tahun setelah saya lulus kuliah di Psikologi UGM, saya belajar dari banyak pengalaman, banyak buku, dan banyak guru untuk menemukan jawaban tentang cara menyembuhkan kekhawatiran. Sebagai seorang manusia, ada sejumlah kekhawatiran dalam hati saya. Di satu sisi, saya tahu benar bahwa selalu khawatir itu tidak baik untuk kesehatan. Di sisi lain, saya masih merasa belum tahu dan belum mampu menyembuhkan kekhawatiran tersebut. Terkait jodoh, karir, keuangan.
“Apa yang sebenarnya bikin kamu khawatir?” Pertanyaan itulah yang seringkali diajukan para guru saya setelah saya menceritakan semuanya soal kekhawatiran. Pertanyaan dijawab dengan pertanyaan.
Rasanya saya ingin bertanya, apakah dengan mengetahui apa yang sebenarnya bikin saya khawatir akan menyembuhkan kekhawatiran yang saya rasakan? Namun, saya tak tergesa mempertanyakan itu. Saya berusaha mencerna dulu.
“Saya mengerti apa yang sebenarnya bikin saya khawatir,” ujar saya, merasa sok tahu. “Tapi, saya ingin menyembuhkan kekhawatiran, bukan ingin mengetahui penyebabnya…”
Guru saya berkata, “Yang sebenarnya bikin kamu khawatir adalah karena pikiranmu penuh dengan masa depan. Maka, sadarilah itu dan latihlah pikiranmu untuk lebih berada di saat ini, di sini-kini.”
Ada yang berontak dalam diri saya. “Iya, lalu gimana caranya melatih pikiran saya agar lebih berada di sini-kini?”
“Latih pikiranmu untuk menyadari napasmu,” ujar guru saya. Saya dengarkan dengan seksama. “Ketika kamu menarik napas, sadari tarikan napasmu. Dan ketika kamu menghembuskan napas, sadari embusan napasmu. Kekhawatiranmu pun akan terurai dengan sendirinya,” lanjut guru saya menjelaskan lebih rinci.
Saya tak ingin mendebat lagi. Maka, saya menjalankan nasihatnya.
Bulan demi bulan, berganti tahun, saya tak kunjung mampu menyembuhkan kekhawatiran saya selama ini. Niat saya untuk menyembuhkannya justru makin kendur karena kian tak yakin apakah saya bisa melakukannya?
Maka saya mendatangi guru saya lagi.
“Saya sudah berlatih,” ujar saya, “tapi, tak ada perubahan.”
Guru saya menatap mata saya, “Teruskan latihanmu,” ujarnya, “kamu hanya berlatih di saat-saat tertentu saja.”
Deg! Tiba-tiba, saya menyadari bahwa selama ini hanya berlatih seenak saya tanpa benar-benar menerapkan pelajarannya dalam hidup sehari-hari.
“Jadi, apa yang harus saya lakukan setelah ini, Guru?”
“Ketika kamu makan, latihlah pikiranmu untuk sadar benar bahwa kamu sedang makan,” jawab guru saya, “kalau pikiranmu mengembara, ajaklah pikiranmu untuk menyadari napasmu, lalu kembali sadari bahwa kamu sedang makan. Nikmati perlahan apa yang sedang kamu gigit, kunyah, dan telan. Sadari pula kehadiran orang yang sedang menemani kamu makan. Maka kekhawatiran pun tidak akan menjerat dirimu. Lakukan pula latihan ini saat kamu berjalan, melakukan hobi, dan bekerja.”
Seketika, ada rasa sejuk dalam hati dan pikiran saya. Ketika saya menggali nasihat itu lebih dalam lagi, latihan sadar diri di sini-kini (mindfulness) akan menjadi penjaga yang membuat saya menjadi manusia yang sembuh dari rasa khawatir.
“Barangsiapa tak pernah melatih pikirannya untuk sadar diri di sini-kini, pikirannya akan lemah mudah khawatir akan masa depan, pun gampang menyesal akan masa lalu.
Barangsiapa tekun melatih pikirannya untuk sadar diri di sini-kini, pikiran sadarnya akan menguat, sehingga lebih mampu menyadari pikiran hanyalah pikiran, bukan kenyataan. Dengan sendirinya, kegaduhan pikiran akan berangsur mereda. Rasa khawatir tak punya daya lagi untuk menyakitinya.”

15,"Depresi: Bukan Lemah, Hanya Lelah, Tak Ada Tempat Berkeluh-kesah",8/7/2017,Eunike K,https://medium.com/@euniceapril/depresi-bukan-lemah-hanya-lelah-tak-ada-tempat-berkeluh-kesah-aa0e4acb9073,"	Waktu memulai untuk mengetikkan satu per satu kata-kata yang ada dalam postingan ini, saya sempat berpikir: “Akankah saya terlihat lemah nantinya? Padahal image yang selama ini saya bangun adalah sosok perempuan yang (mungkin kelihatannya) tegar, tidak terlalu peduli dengan pendapat orang lain, dan selalu bisa mengatasi masalah apapun.”
Ada sebuah ketakutan yang saya rasa akan menelanjangi saya habis-habisan. Maklum saja, di era ini, kita semua berlomba-lomba untuk membuat image, seperti apa orang akan melihat kita, karena dari situlah juga bisa terlihat bagaimana orang akan memperlakukan kita.
	Bagi beberapa orang, saya mungkin saja terlihat sebagai sosok yang bahagia, tidak pernah punya masalah, tidak approachable, bawel, tukang marah-marah dan kalau sudah ngomel tidak bisa berhenti, sebuah sosok yang arogan, sempat ada yang mengatakan megalomaniak, mungkin punya potensi untuk menjadi seseorang yang sangat diktator. Tidak hanya itu saja, anggapan-anggapan seperti selalu merasa tahu segalanya (padahal mungkin hanya tahu permukaannya saja), keras kepala, tidak dapat menerima kritik, terkesan bersandiwara dan membuat drama serta masih banyak lagi deretan hal yang diutarakan kepada saya. Yang lebih menyedihkan adalah, saya tidak pernah menyadari bahwa beberapa dari hal itu adalah benar adanya. Hal-hal tersebut menjadi kanker yang menyebar ke setiap sudut diri saya, yang sudah mengakar dan entah apakah hal itu bisa disembuhkan.
	Sebuah kebutuhan untuk selalu terlihat tidak lemah, tanpa saya sadari membuat saya merasakan depresi yang begitu berat. Mulai dari merasakan kegelisahan yang akut hingga menganggu pola tidur, gemar berbicara sendiri, sampai punya asumsi-asumsi tidak jelas yang wara-wiri di dalam kepala. Jika sudah sampai tahap tersebut, bahkan menangis saja sulit. Namun, ketika pecah, akhirnya muncul perdebatan terhadap diri sendiri atau yang lebih menyakitkan adalah melakukan perdebatan tidak jelas dengan orang lain. Saya sama sekali merasa bahwa ini adalah sesuatu yang tidak sehat.
Hal ini pun membuat saya selalu merasa antipati dengan manusia dan dunia yang ada di sekitar saya. Saya benar-benar tidak bisa menceritakan apa yang saya rasakan hingga akhirnya saya membuat benteng pertahanan terhadap diri sendiri dan jika keresahan itu datang dan sedang parah-parahnya, yang saya bisa lakukan hanya membenamkan bantal ke kepala dan berteriak sekencang-kencangnya. Namun, alih-alih merasa bahwa ada sesuatu yang lepas, saya malah merasa semakin sakit, seperti ada yang tertahan, yang tidak bisa hilang begitu saja dengan menangis. Lebih buruknya lagi, yang selalu saya tanamkan pada diri sendiri adalah sebuah pemikiran yang menyatakan bahwa manusia hidup di dunia ini sendiri, saya tidak percaya dengan konsep manusia adalah makhluk sosial yang harus berinteraksi satu sama lain. Bagi saya mungkin mendengarkan cerita dan keluh-kesah orang dapat membantu dia melalui saat-saat terburuknya, tapi saya tidak memperlakukan hal tersebut ke diri saya sendiri. Untuk saya, akan menjadi sangat merepotkan sekali jika orang harus capek-capek mendengarkan kisah hidup saya yang membosankan. Saya selalu berpikir bahwa setiap orang punya battle field mereka sendiri dan saya tidak mau menambah pertarungan mereka dengan kisah-kisah bodoh saya. Tidak jarang juga saya membuat ‘sweet escape’ saya sendiri dengan melakukan banyak hal, mulai dari melakukan planking sampai 2 menit padahal kondisi tubuh sedang tidak fit, atau membuang uang untuk makan enak (ini memangnya salah ya?), membeli baju yang padahal sebetulnya ya saya pakai juga, bukan jadi sia-sia, hanya saja mungkin terlalu sering hanya untuk menutup/mengobati kegelisahan yang sedang dialami…intinya adalah menggunakan uang sebagai alternatif pelarian. Dari situ sebetulnya saya menciptakan dunia yang lebih gelap. Pikiran saya seakan-akan tidak bisa di-shutdown layaknya laptop yang digunakan untuk bekerja. Akhirnya walaupun tidak dalam konteks pekerjaan, saya selalu mengharuskan pikiran saya untuk bekerja. Mengapa? Karena saya ingin menciptakan pengalihan yang lebih banyak supaya saya tidak larut dalam kesedihan dan memikirkan hal-hal yang mungkin bisa membuat saya melakukan tindakan yang tidak baik. Jika sudah sampai di level yang sangat melelahkan, kadang walaupun tidak flu atau batuk atau demam, saya senang mengkonsumsi obat yang dapat menyebabkan kantuk lumayan berat (kandungan yang terdapat pada obat-obat untuk demam dan flu). Menurut saya, tidur adalah obat paling mujarab saat pikiran sudah tak dapat dikendalikan lagi. Entah depresi atau bukan namanya, tapi hal ini sebenarnya sudah berjalan selama 2 tahun terakhir, hanya saja semakin menjadi-jadi selama 6 bulan terakhir. Bukan hanya stress yang dikarenakan pekerjaan, tapi menumpuk dengan sejuta hal yang kalau dipikir-pikir ya tidak penting juga untuk dipikirkan. Hanya saja memaknai “tidak penting” itu ternyata tidak semudah yang saya bayangkan. Akan banyak yang memberi nasihat seperti “Coba ngobrol sama teman, perluas pergaulan”, atau perkataan seperti “Emang nggak sayang sama hidup, lu belum tua loh ini, kok udah depresi aja”, mungkin juga ada yang memberi pendapat “Lah elu itu lah, apa-apa dipikirin, makanya jadi capek sendiri kan?” Depresi itu adalah hal yang rumit. Ahli kesehatan bisa punya 1001 alasan atau bahkan pencegahan yang bisa dilakukan. Tapi terkadang mungkin sang penderita tidak butuh banyak jawaban atau bahkan sampai bantuan medis yang terlalu rumit, mungkin mereka butuh manusia, tapi manusia yang seperti apa dan harus apa? Atau jika sudah tidak ada solusi yang baik untuk dijalankan, mungkin itulah di saat orang merasa bahwa akan lebih baik untuk mengakhiri hidup. At the end of the day, it’s your call. Hidup tidak akan kembali ke saat-saat yang kita inginkan, yang saya lakukan mungkin lebih banyak penyesalan, tapi yang selalu jadi pertanyaan, bagaimana saya bisa memperbaiki sesuatu yang akhirnya menjadi penyesalan tersebut?",Kesehatan Mental
16,Awal Mula ke Psikolog,4/13/2023,Meutia Faradilla,https://medium.com/@meutia.faradilla/awal-mula-ke-psikolog-f6c344150506,"Kalau ada yang bertanya, bagaimana saya mengetahui saya bipolar. Jawabannya sederhana saja. Psikiater yang bilang. Soalnya itu ranahnya mereka untuk menegakkan diagnosis bipolar. Saya sendiri awalnya ‘denial’ dengan kondisi bipolar ini, karena empat tahun sudah menerima bahwa saya adalah penderita depresi mayor. Namun, cerita tentang denial ini disimpan dulu.
Nah, sekarang kalau ditanya kok bisa saya memutuskan pergi ke profesional kesehatan jiwa? Ini baru ceritanya berangkat dari diri saya sendiri. Jadi, saat itu seorang teman online mengunggah suatu post beserta gambar tentang tanda-tanda orang mengalami gangguan depresi. Rasanya ada sepuluh tanda. Iseng-iseng saya membacanya, dan saya tertegun, “Kok semua ada di saya?” Lalu, saya bilang pada teman ini, bahwa semua tanda tersebut ada di saya. Dia langsung mengirimkan pesan pribadi dan meminta saya untuk pergi ke psikolog, untuk memeriksakan diri. Awalnya saya masih ragu, karena takut dianggap mengada-ngada. Tapi, kemudian kondisi ini berlanjut terus sampai seorang teman lain juga mendorong saya agar memeriksakan diri ke psikolog.
Saat itu saya tidak tahu harus menghubungi psikolog yang mana. Lalu saya bertanya pada teman yang tinggal di satu kota, psikolog mana yang dia rekomendasikan. Dia menyarankan saya berkonsultasi dengan Kak Yulia Direzkia, beliau memiliki spesialisasi di penanganan trauma. Hati kecil saya bilang, “Wah, pas banget ini kayaknya, karena saya menduga saya punya akar trauma.”
Kemudian saya menghubungi tempat beliau praktik, dan membuat janji temu (nah ini, kalau ke psikolog kita harus buat janji temu dulu ya, teman-teman). Di pertemuan pertama, saya ditanyakan kenapa merasa perlu berkonsultasi. Saya menceritakan apa yang saya rasakan selama beberapa pekan terakhir, dan bilang bahwa saya membutuhkan konsultasi. Lalu entah bagaimana, pembicaraan sampai pada dugaan saya bahwa saya memiliki trauma masa kecil. Kami lalu menggali hal tersebut. Saya yang tadinya cengengesan saja, mendadak berderai air mata. Rupanya, luka trauma itu cukup pedih juga ketika diungkit dalam keadaan belum diproses. Di pertemuan pertama itu, selain kami mengidentifikasi trauma-trauma yang terjadi, kami juga menyusun rencana terapi. Seperti berapa kali terapi akan dilakukan, terapinya apa, prosesnya bagaimana, dan apa yang bisa diharapkan dari terapi yang dijalankan. Sejak saat itu, proses terapi saya berlangsung sebagaimana mestinya, hingga nanti saya mengalami suatu hal yang membuat saya dirujuk ke psikiater (tapi, itu cerita lain lagi).
Pelajaran penting dari cerita ini adalah, pertama, kenalilah diri sendiri. Amati bagaimana perasaan dan mood sehari-hari. Kalau berubah dan perubahannya terjadi cukup lama, sudah bisa mencari bantuan profesional kesehatan jiwa. Terutama kalau berdampak pada aktivitas sehari-hari. Bisa dicoba dari psikolog dulu, kalau tidak membaik atau dirujuk, bisa ke psikiater untuk mendapatkan bantuan obat. Kedua, kita sebagai makhluk sosial berusahalah lebih peduli terutama terhadap teman-teman dan orang di sekeliling kita. Kalau teman kita yang biasanya ceria jadi diam saja, atau jadi tidak mau kemana-mana, boleh ditanya dia kenapa. Sediakan bahu untuk bersandar, dan telinga untuk mendengar. Dorong teman kita untuk mencari bantuan kesehatan jiwa bila perlu (tapi, jangan dipaksa). Keberadaan kita membuat mereka yang sedang berada dalam kegelapan tidak akan merasa sendiri. Membuat mereka akan berusaha mencoba bertahan. Ketiga, mencari bantuan kesehatan jiwa bukan berarti kita lemah atau kurang iman. Justru kita sedang kuat dan sedang berusaha sedemikian rupa agar kondisi kita membaik. Justru kita sedang sayang sama diri sendiri. Karena, layaknya sakit fisik lainnya, gangguan mental juga butuh dibenahi (saya tidak perlu bercerita kan bahwa penderita gangguan mental itu mengalami perubahan secara kimiawi dan fisik di otak mereka?).
Kesehatan jiwa sama pentingnya dengan kesehatan fisik. Kesehatan jiwa bukan suatu yang mengawang-awang, ia terjadi di tubuh kita, di otak kita. Maka perlakukanlah penyakit kejiwaan seperti penyakit fisik lainnya. Artinya apa? Obati ia. Dan layaknya pengobatan penyakit lain, ada terapi nonfarmakologi (tanpa obat) dan farmakologi. Pada gangguan mental, terapi nonfarmakologinya apa? Psikoterapi. Terapi farmakologinya? Obat. Gabungkan keduanya. Dan mari bersama membuat lingkungan yang lebih ramah bagi sesama. Yang lebih berwelas asih. Yang lebih sehat.

17,Depresi. Masa sih?,2/6/2022,Fitriana Citra Pratiwi,https://medium.com/@citra.fitriana/depresi-masa-sih-6a84e2689d8,"	Semua berawal dari tahun 2018. Tepatnya bulan April setelah meninggalnya Ayah. Saat itu masih belum mengerti tentang depresi dan sejenisnya, yang saya tau hanya grieving. Seperti biasa, karena enggak tau harus diapakan rasa ‘depresi’ tersebut maka saya lari ke alkohol dan hal-hal lainnya. Hampir setiap hari nya mabuk, kadang 5 hari berturut-turut. Enggak pernah ada kemauan untuk pulang ke rumah kalau belum capek alias langsung tidur.
Selalu berusaha cari distraksi untuk tidak terus-terusan berduka. Tapi, hal tersebut lebih mudah diucapkan daripada dilakukan. Perlahan mulai merasa aneh karena setiap datang rasa sedih tidak selalu jelas sedihnya karena apa. Perlahan isi kepala mulai ramai, isinya menyebalkan semua sampai-sampai berfikir, “akan lebih baik sepertinya kalau enggak hidup. Lebih damai, enggak perlu mendengarkan suara-suara aneh dan racing thoughts. Entah sudah berapa kali memikirkan untuk bunuh diri dengan berbagai cara. Hingga akhirnya self-harm karena sakit secara emosi enggak bisa dimengerti datangnya darimana dan bagaimana cara untuk menyalurkannya dengan benar.
Selalu bertanya, “kapan sih grieving ini selesai? kapan sih berenti ngerasa sedih karena kehilangan?”
Awal tahun 2020 tidak begitu sering kambuh. Mungkin sesekali menangis karena sedih yang tidak pernah tau penyebab nya apa namun, suara-suara di kepala tidak begitu ramai seperti dulu. Namun, lagi dan lagi harus berurusan dengan kematian. Ditambah saat itu suasana pandemi COVID-19 sedang meningkat. Harus bolak-balik mengurus yang isoman dan juga mengurusi Yangkung yg dirawat di UGD. Ditambah pekerjaan yang tidak bisa ditinggal.
Sepeninggal Yangti dan Yangkung ternyata depresi tersebut muncul kembali. Terasa berat karena rasa sakit hati dan sedih ditinggal ayah masih belum selesai lalu harus kembali berhadapan ditinggal oleh Yangti dan Yangkung. Sejak saat itu mulai sering sedih, mencari distraksi, menyalahkan diri sendiri; seandainya waktu itu memberikan tenaga yang maksimal dalam mengurus Yangti dan Yangkung mungkin ceritanya berbeda.
	Beberapa hari setelah meninggalnya Yangti dan Yangkung, mulailah muncul rasa sedih, penyesalan dan marah. Belum selesai menerima kenyataan bahwa ayah sudah meninggal, ditambah dengan Yangti dan Yangkung meninggal. Awalnya berfikir, “nanti lama-lama juga biasa kok. Toh, orang lain jug sudah ada yang ditinggal anggota keluarga tetapi mereka sudah ikhlas.” Tapi, tidak bisa semudah itu.
Setiap teringat ayah, Yangti dan Yangkung seketika menangis, marah, dan capek. Rasa sedih muncul dengan sendirinya tanpa ada sebab. Kembali melakukan self-harm dan menangis serta memaki diri sendiri. Semua emosi terkuras habis sampai tidak ingin melakukan aktifitas apapun selain bermalas-malasan. Puncaknya adalah muncul rasa sedih dan suara-suara yang mengganggu serta racing thoughts yang membuat lelah.
Panick attack pun muncul; di busway dalam perjalanan ke kantor, saat di kantor, ataupun saat di rumah. Akhirnya memutuskan untuk ke Poli Jiwa ditemani suami. Beberapa kali sempat mengulur karena merasa diri ini baik-baik aja; mungkin karena sedang bad mood? Mungkin karena hormon tidak stabil pra menstruasi? Begitu banyak alasan sampai akhirnya memberanikan diri untuk ke Poli Jiwa. Jantung serasa berdetak lebih cepat, cemas, gelisah, dan ingin pulang saat menunggu giliran untuk dipanggil dokter.
Sampai akhirnya nama saya dipanggil. Tidak pernah terpikirkan akan menemui dokter Poli Jiwa, let alone akan ngomong apa dengan dokternya, tapi, hanya dengan 1 pertanyaan dari dokter berhasil membuat saya membuka semua hal-hal yang dirasakan selama ini. Saya pun diberikan rujukan untuk konsul dengan Psikolog serta Psikiater secara berbarengan. Seusai dari Poli Jiwa, beberapa beban seperti sudah terangkat namun masih ada yang harus ditangani. Menerima kenyataan bahwa saya depresi berat adalah hal yang tidak mudah. Bagaimana kalau depresi nya menghalangi saya untuk menjadi manusia normal? Bagaimana kalau saya akan menggunakan depresi sebagai alasan dari hal apapun yang saya lakukan? Apakah saya bisa sembuh? Apakah saya bisa punya anak dengan keadaan seperti ini?
Saya hanya ingin jadi manusia normal yang menjalani hari-hari nya dengan baik tanpa diselimuti kecemasan, suara-suara yang mengganggu serta overthingking.

18,Saya dan Bipolar,4/13/2023,Meutia Faradilla,https://medium.com/@meutia.faradilla/saya-dan-bipolar-2113941877a3,"	Saya masih ingat ketika saya membaca pertama kali kata bipolar di rekam medis pengobatan saya. Saat itu saya duduk di ruang tunggu rumah sakit jiwa, menunggu perawat untuk menyerahkan rekam medik yang baru saya ambil dari bagian pendaftaran, dan iseng-iseng saya melihat apa saja yang ditulis oleh para psikiater yang mengobati saya (karena saya pakai skema BPJS, jadi psikiaternya berganti-ganti, tergantung siapa yang sedang piket di jadwal saya datang). Membaca tulisan tangan psikiater terakhir yang menangani saya dan tertera “bipolar disorder”, membuat badan saya terasa panas dingin. Bipolar? Are you sure? Itu pertanyaan yang ada di benak saya. Pengetahuan saya tentang bipolar betul-betul terbatas saat itu, dan saya hanya tahu orang bipolar mengalami dua fase. Depresi dan mania/manic. Saya tidak merasa memiliki kondisi manic sama sekali. Darah naik ke ubun-ubun kepala saya, bagaimana mungkin saya didiagnosis bipolar. Wong selama ini saya depresi, kok. Saya nggak manic.
	 saya teringat, teman saya (yang pertama kali mendorong saya ke psikolog untuk menangani depresi saya) pernah mencetuskan gagasan bipolar. Jadi begini, saya bercerita padanya kalau saya relapse depresi beberapa kali, lalu dia bilang, “Coba tanya sama psikiater lo deh, itu bipolar bukan. Soalnya salah satu ciri bipolar itu depresinya berulang relapse.” Saat itu saya ragu akan hal itu. Dan saya masih memegang teguh kalau saya hanya depresi. Untungnya di hari itu, saya bertemu kembali dengan dokter yang menangani saya sebelumnya. Saya bertanya, kenapa saya didiagnosis bipolar. Padahal yang saya rasakan hanya depresi. Lalu psikiaternya mengatakan, saat dia meminta saya menceritakan riwayat sakit saya, saya menyebutkan depresi yang relapse berkali-kali. Dan meskipun tidak ada mania, tapi ada kondisi membaik yang membuat saya bersemangat di antara relapse depresi itu. Dan itu termasuk pada kondisi bipolar tipe II. Saya sempat tertegun beberapa detik, karena saya baru tahu ada yang namanya bipolar tipe II.
Pulang dari rumah sakit, saya bercerita pada teman saya tadi. “Gue didiagnosis bipolar, kayak kata lo.” Dan dia langsung memberikan bacaan-bacaan tentang bipolar. Sebagai pembaca yang budiman, saya langsung melahap dua buku tentang bipolar. Bipolar for dummies yang pertama dan dari situ saya mengetahui, bahwa bipolar itu ada beberapa tipe dan yang saya alami adalah bipolar tipe II, dimana ada fase depresif dan fase hipomanik. Fase hipomanik ini adalah fase bersemangat yang tidak sampai berlebihan. Dan pada bipolar tipe II, yang paling kentara adalah fase depresifnya.
	Melanjutkan bacaan bipolar, saya juga mencari beberapa video Youtube yang membahas tentang bipolar. Satu channel video edukasi kesehatan jiwa yang sangat saya suka adalah channelnya Dr. Tracey Marks. Topik yang dibahas lengkap, durasi videonya tidak terlalu panjang (ini penting buat saya yang malas melihat video), dan bahasanya lugas serta sederhana. Saya menjadi tambah mengerti tentang bipolar dan tipe-tipenya dan jenis obat-obatan yang perlu diberikan. Perubahan diagnosis dari depresi menjadi bipolar sebenarnya agak menakutkan buat saya. Kenapa? Karena kalau depresi saja, saya masih ada harapan untuk menghentikan pengobatan. Untuk kembali ke kondisi semula. Namun, kalau bipolar? Berbagai hasil penelitian dan tatalaksana pengobatan yang ada sangat menganjurkan pengobatan bipolar dilakukan seumur hidup. Bahkan baru-baru ini ada artikel yang ditulis oleh seorang psikiater yang membahas soal putus obat pada bipolar dan kenapa itu tidak disarankan. Butuh waktu bagi saya untuk lapang dada menerima bahwa kondisi saya ini butuh dijaga oleh pengobatan yang rutin. Dan saya harus merawat diri dengan lebih apik lagi, misalnya dengan melakukan meditasi dan journaling. Pola makan juga harusnya dijaga, karena banyak penelitian yang membahas kaitan erat antara saluran cerna dan otak (tapi ini saya masih susah menjaganya).
Barangkali setelah beberapa minggu, setelah selesai membaca buku-buku dan menonton video-video tentang bipolar saya baru bisa menerima kondisi ini. Saya tidak melihatnya sebagai kutukan atau ancaman. Saya melihatnya sebagai teman. Bipolar ini menemani saya dalam perjalanan hidup. Fase depresif yang pernah muncul adalah fase untuk melindungi saya dari ancaman, yang membuat saya berhenti dan menyimpan energi. Fase hipomania yang hadir memacu saya untuk bekerja dengan lebih baik. Saya berterima kasih karena keduanya pernah hadir. Namun, sekarang, saya membutuhkan sesuaut yang lebih stabil. Saya butuh diri saya yang lebih stabil, oleh karena itu saya minum obat. Saya butuh diri saya yang hadir senantiasa terlepas apapun keadaannya.
Saya sebelum mendapatkan diagnosis gangguan kejiwaan, baik itu depresi maupun bipolar, adalah saya yang sama dengan saat ini. Saya tetap bisa bekerja dan beraktivitas dengan baik. Saya tetap perform. Saya tetap bisa bercanda dan tertawa. Diagnosis tidak mengubah siapa saya. Diagnosis memperkaya hidup saya, karena saya jadi mengenal banyak hal, dan yang paling penting, saya jadi mengenal diri saya lebih dari sebelumnya. Dan saya lebih mencintai diri saya daripada sebelumnya.

19,Read This If You're An Old Soul Who Feels Lost,9/18/2021,Shahida Arabi,https://thoughtcatalog.com/shahida-arabi/2017/09/11-revolutionary-truths-old-souls-learn-the-hard-way/,"	If you often feel like a centuries-old soul trapped in a twenty-something body, you’re not alone.  Regardless of what your belief systems may be, it’s undeniable that there are certain people who are dealt very difficult cards in life and they reap hard-earned insights from their adversity. We call these people by many names: trauma survivors, wounded warriors, “old souls,” empaths, misfits, outsiders. 
Whatever label they fall under, their souls feel absolutely ancient and there is often a great deal of  personal obstacles that come with their journey. They go through life constantly in search of a place that feels like “home” – mentally, physically and spiritually.
Old souls have to play the hell out of the cards they’ve been dealt in order to tap into the wisdom of this lifetime. Here are the eleven life-changing truths old souls learn – the hard way:
1. You are here to break the cycle.
Whether it be generational abuse, harmful beliefs passed down from parent to child or toxic habits that have plagued you for what seems like a lifetime, you were not meant to live a life repeating the same dysfunctional patterns that have hindered your peace of mind time and time again.
Whatever destructive patterns you’re engaging in, it’s fruitful to understand how the cycle first began and how it was cemented, over and over again into a seemingly endless loop. Doing so can be counterintuitive, because it means not giving up the pattern cold turkey but actively listening to and honoring what it has to tell you. If you have an unhealthy pattern of negative self-talk and self-sabotage that keeps hindering the manifestation of your desires, find the source of the voice. 
Then, understand why it thinks it has to protect you by sabotaging you. In many ways, self-sabotage is a misguided form of protection. Self-sabotage “protects” you from playing big in a world where you were taught to play small.
2. There is no such thing as a truly “safe” relationship until there is safety from within. With each new relationship, there is a risk of vulnerability. Risk is intrinsic to intimacy but the growth is inevitable.
This newfound habit of interrupting dysfunctional cycles extends beyond just your relationship with yourself; we break and reinforce cycles when we engage in relationships with others.
Old souls can fall into a pattern of becoming ensnared in toxic relationships. They are seemingly forced to continually step outside of their comfort zone in turbulent relationships that challenge their identity and beliefs. In reality, however, in dating the same people with different faces, they actually build new “comfort zones” that feed into existing patterns.
These patterns are ingrained in ancient wounds that demand a second look. If you have a habit of chasing emotionally unavailable people, it’s necessary to look at your own emotional unavailability which may be keeping you trapped in unsatisfying relationships. While this is usually subconscious, there may be something ultimately enticing about the emotionally unavailable partner that allows you to build the illusion of “safety” where there is actually grave danger.
Consider children who are severely bullied or neglected. They do not feel safe trusting in another human being that could potentially harm them, yet they are later drawn to similarly dangerous people in adulthood because they have been programmed to seek out the familiar. The emotional unavailability and toxicity of a partner can be inviting for them as adults, if only because it represents a form of psychological distance.
3. Being compassionate doesn’t mean you have to be anyone’s emotional punching bag. It often means being your own “guru” in setting healthy boundaries.
Many spiritual gurus purport that we’re here on this planet to learn how to love unconditionally. This belief, however, is disgracefully exploited by toxic people and should always be taken with a grain of salt when it comes to sacrificing your needs for emotional predators. Cultivate that sense of unconditional love for yourself, first and foremost, and you’ll learn that abuse has no place in self-reverence.
Those who preach “love and light” without including the art of self-compassion and boundary setting are missing the crucial ingredients of self-respect and authentic growth. The truth is, enabling toxicity doesn’t do you or the person you’re excusing any favors.
Loving everyone indiscriminately has its dangers; it doesn’t give your soul the navigation it needs to find the tribe that resonates with how exquisite you truly are. It doesn’t give other souls the accountability they need to learn their own lessons, either.
It always bears repeating that you are a divine being and you are here to be cherished as such. You can in fact still be a loving, respectful and compassionate human being without taking anyone else’s shit or overlooking the transgressions that are at the root of conflict and incompatibility.
4. Contributing to someone’s mission is wonderful, but your true purpose may be larger than life.
Inside of every old soul is an aching longing for something greater than themselves; they know intuitively that they are meant for something more than the life they’re living. Your current 9-to-5 job, while suitable and convenient, may not be what makes your heart skip a beat or your soul jumpstart into ecstasy. Whether it’s a side hustle or the courage to live out your true passion full-time, don’t devote your entire life to building someone else’s empire when you could also be spending some time building your own.
It’s possible to be both practical and passionate. Make space and time for your own talents, goals and dreams. Give back to the communities that have fostered your own growth and the causes that are a part of your life story. Your hardships can be the guide to the populations you’re here to help and serve. Honor what authentically excites you and become a leader in the field that makes you motivated to get up every morning; don’t sacrifice or eradicate your true gifts just so you can cultivate someone else’s mission. You have your own mission to carry out and the possibilities are infinite; there are multiple ways to explore the gifts that you’ve been given. Even if you have no clue what that might be, start small by thinking about what makes your soul feel most alive. Chances are, your soul already knows deep down what that is.
5. The ability to enjoy being alone is a goddamn superpower.
Society might try to convince you to partner up as quickly as possible, to surround yourself with a plethora of friends and to self-medicate by constantly socializing. Yet how are you meant to grow as an individual, if you spend most of your time drowning out what your soul is dying to tell you with the noise of other people’s neuroses and projections?
Take a year off of relationships to self-reflect and “date” yourself; being single can be a revolutionary period that can teach you how to give to yourself more fully and become rooted in your own authenticity without requiring anyone else’s validation. You’re meant to spend some time alone – growing, reflecting, and flourishing. Learning how to enjoy being alone can be one of your greatest assets as a human being and a natural way to filter out toxic people from your life. After all, when you learn how to enjoy your own company, you’ll find that it is much more preferable to tolerating someone else’s bullshit just for the sake of avoiding solitude.
6. You don’t exist to do things half-assed.
You’re here to dive in deep and savor everything just as much as you are here to fulfill your true potential. You’re here to have careers, friends and relationship partners that nourish you on a level that you haven’t been before – not superficial alliances that deplete and drain you. You’re not here to settle for or bow down to those who give you crumbs. You’re not here to waste time catering to people that couldn’t care less if they destroyed you in the process of getting what they want.
Cherish quality over quantity; one good friend is more satisfying than several false ones. A career you love is far more enriching than one you have to force yourself to pursue just because of the title it offers. Life is simultaneously too short and far too long to be spending your time doing anything or being with anyone less than what genuinely nurtures you.
7. Your disowned parts are just as important as your public persona.
We all have an “ideal” person we would love to be 24/7. These are authentic parts of us that also happen to be socially acceptable. It’s wonderful to be friendly, generous and kind. But if there are parts you’re not owning about yourself, there are also facets of your identity that you’re not allowing to become integrated in a healthy way. Maybe let your dark sense of humor come out to play or your coy sensuality take over for a decadent evening. These inner parts deserve just as much air to breathe.
In fact, you’ll find that when you don’t give these inner parts air time, they’ll find mischievous ways of coming out nonetheless. Your hidden desires always have a way of speaking through your choices, no matter how hard you try to repress or silence them. 
8. Abundance and miracles are your birthright.
Your soul knows deep down that you are meant to be wealthy in every aspect – in relationships, in finances, in career success. Everyone defines abundance in different ways. Whatever “wealth” means to you, you are deserving of it. 
You are so worthy of it all, even if your internal programming, childhood wounding and societal conditioning have convinced you otherwise.
Society wants to feed you a limited version of what life can be because it is deeply terrified of people who not only go after their big dreams, but require no one else to depend on for their victories. Small-minded people are also haunted by those who succeed in areas that they have yet to thrive in.
Instead of allowing these limiting core beliefs and naysayers to drive you into a scarcity mindset that doesn’t truly belong to you, you can be open to enhancing success in all areas of your life. You are a divine being and you deserve to feel “rich” in everything you do.
9. Ecstasy is your love letter to yourself.
Self-discipline is admirable and should be cultivated in all areas of your life. However, your lifeline to success shouldn’t be dependent on deprivation.
Old souls often find comfort in restricting themselves, but what they forget is that relishing the beauties of the physical world can be just as spiritual as sitting down to meditate.
Pleasure gives you access to a world where resistance and inhibition loosen, façades drop, instinct reigns and the primal is honored for what it is.
Give yourself permission to surrender to what gives you pure, unadulterated ecstasy from time to time. You’re not here to starve, emotionally, psychologically or physically. You’re here to slow down and take it all in – every touch, every scent, every extravagant source of bliss. You’re here to be mindful of every delightful moment – from savoring a breathtaking sunset to relishing the rapture of a lover.
10. Emotionally desensitizing yourself or spiritually bypassing the pain cuts you off from the power of self-transformation. Gratitude means celebrating the things that are working, not sugarcoating or sweeping everything under the rug.
New age philosophies emphasize the power of positive thinking – sometimes to an extent where it can be more harmful than helpful.
The practice of gratitude comes with a caveat, because being grateful isn’t about being in denial. It’s about acknowledging the basic needs that are being met every day that you might otherwise take for granted. It’s about remembering what you already have and celebrating the incredible manifestations in your life that you were praying for years ago.  Bless your newfound career, the roof over your head, the clean water you’re able to drink, your loving friends, the kind compliment you received – bless them all, every day in every way – without invalidating any pain or trauma you may be encountering. As humans, our natural instincts drive us to focus on the negative aspects of life to avoid and mitigate potential threats; gratitude helps you balance the emotional seesaw without sacrificing your authenticity. You’re here to lead a charmed life – one filled with miracles, synchronicity and abundance beyond your wildest dreams.
That doesn’t mean closing yourself off to uncomfortable emotions in the process, because in the midst of the discomfort is where true change and catharsis can happen.
It doesn’t mean not being angry or outraged when you are violated; in fact, honoring your anger is just as sacred of a practice as being grateful. It gives you access to the boundary-building that you might feel otherwise too timid to undertake.
It doesn’t mean refusing to seek help that will heal you; on the contrary, you’re receptive to it all because you know that with pain comes the potential for self-examination and transformation.

Don’t waste too much time feeling sorry for yourself. As long as you grow from the experience and try your best to do better in the future, then you should be proud of yourself. You’re only human. You’re not always going to say the right thing at the right time. You’re bound to fumble and fall. What matters most is how you bounce back from those setbacks. 
Keep going, even if you feel completely alone. There are more people in this world who care about you than you realize. Even if you’ve lost a few along the way, there will be more waiting around the corner. Remember, you are worthy of attention and affection and undying love. You are going to find your people eventually. They’re out there, and they’re probably feeling as lost as you are right now — but once you come together, everything will feel right.
Keep going, even when you feel hopeless. Don’t give up on yourself because you are overflowing with potential. You are destined for beautiful things, but you need to stick around long enough to experience them. Even though it’s tempting to give up, you owe it to yourself to keep trying. It might be hard today, and it might be even harder tomorrow, but eventually making it through the day won’t be a struggle anymore. Eventually, you’ll discover the happiness you’ve deserved all along.
Keep going, even when times are hard. Life isn’t always going to be fun and exciting. There are going to be road bumps and obstacles along your journey. You’re going to have moments when you feel like everything is coming together and moments when it feels like everything is falling apart. This is normal. This is what it means to be human.
Keep going, even when you aren’t sure what you want out of this world. Even when you feel like there’s nothing out there that could possibly make you happy. Remember, the way you’re feeling right now is temporary. You’re not going to feel so uncomfortable forever. But you need to make the choice to take care of yourself. You need to put effort into feeling better because you deserve to be okay.
Keep going, even when you’re exhausted. Remember, strength doesn’t mean putting on a fake smile and accomplishing everything on your to-do list. Sometimes, strength is simply getting out of bed in the morning and making yourself your favorite breakfast. Sometimes, strength is stepping into a cold shower when all you want to do is sleep. If you can’t do anything big, start with the small things. And if you can’t do the small things, that’s okay too. Sometimes, you need a second. Rest isn’t the enemy. You need to recharge. But you also need to have faith in yourself. You need to pick yourself up and keep going.",Kesehatan Mental
21,Why We Keep Trying After We Fail,11/4/2021,Susmitha Chinni,https://thoughtcatalog.com/susmitha-chinni/2021/07/why-we-keep-trying-after-we-fail/,"	The expression “pushing a rock up a hill” is used when handling a frustrating or pointless task. The origin behind the phrase comes from the story of Sisyphus. His story is a lesson for humans who try to cheat death. While taking a closer look at Sisyphus, I tried to imagine what his situation felt like. I asked myself, “How would I have responded if I were Sisyphus?” If you are unfamiliar with the Greek story of Sisyphus, please take a seat in my figurative story-telling circle. 
	In Greek mythology, Sisyphus was the King of Corinth and an infamous trickster. He found himself in trouble with Zeus after cheating death twice. The first time by trapping his guard, the personified Thanatos, in hell. The second time by finding a loophole in burial procedures and persuading Persephone to release him. Zeus gave Sisyphus the eternal punishment of pushing a boulder up a steep hill. The punishment was cruel because it was impossible to complete the task and also maddened Sisyphus. The original tale served as a fable for those who try to cheat fate or mortality. However, the longer you think about Sisyphus’s tale, you cannot help but feel sorry for the guy. From the Odyssey, the protagonist Homer says “[t]hen I witnessed the torture of Sisyphus, as he wrestled with a huge rock with both hands. Bracing himself and thrusting with hands and feet he pushed the boulder uphill to the top. But every time, as he was about to send it toppling over the crest, its sheer weight turned it back, and once again towards the plain the pitiless rock rolled down. So once more he had to wrestle with the thing and push it up, while the sweat poured from his limbs and the dust rose high above his head.”
A nagging voice in my head asked, “Why didn’t he stop pushing or refuse to push?” The logic behind my thinking was that if Sisyphus refused to push the boulder, he could avoid the whole situation entirely. Sisyphus would be free from Zeus’s punishment. However, I realized the punishment was not only about the physical aspect of pushing a boulder for all of eternity. There was an even greater punishment underneath the task at hand. Zeus took Sisyphus’s sense of purpose. He was neither living nor dying; he was stuck. What was his motivation? It is in Chinese Tao’s philosophy to follow the flow of nature and assist it. Narratively, this makes sense as to why Zeus had to step in. Sisyphus tried to fight the nature of death. Zeus taking Sisyphus’s sense of purpose was removing his meaning of life. If you put yourself in Sisyphus’s shoes, you were this clever king who thought he could be immortal like gods. Then you are stripped of your life and placed in a personalized spot in hell (Hades). You know that whatever you do, the result will always end the same way. How do you find the will to continue, let alone carry out your sentence? By accepting his punishment and following the sequence of consequences, Sisyphus was able to find a deeper meaning.
There are many tasks that we face which feel impossible or pointless. Sisyphus finds purpose for himself in engaging in that process of pushing the rock. The point isn’t about getting the rock on top of the hill, but for him to live with purpose. Despite knowing the end result of the same boulder tumbling down the path he had pushed, Sisyphus continues to try again. Sisyphus maintains a self of identity and purpose by continuing to push the rock up a hill. While the rock may never reach the top of the hill, Sisyphus continues to practice exercising his strength. He still reaps the benefits from engaging in the process. Engaging in the process means we act with intent. Intention behind our actions helps us live with purpose and choose to act on what we can control. Purpose is how we deal with adversity. Whether it be pushing up a literal or metaphorical rock up a mountain, the most important thing is to try.

That empty-handed is never what you want to be, because those who go at life solo are broken. They don’t fit. They don’t function. They aren’t whole. And maybe you feel that way sometimes.

Are you less of a person because you’re alone? Does winning always have to fit an accepted mold?
Lies are so hard to detangle, to scrub from your skin. But no matter how much you bleed, you’ve got to cut them out. You deserve to know the truth, to know that it’s okay to be alone.
It’s okay to be alone and have no one around to hear the rise and fall of your breath or the rhythmic beating of your heart. And it’s even okay to not be comfortable with that kind of silence yet—you cannot find yourself all in one day.
Maybe this is the time you need to realize that you are allowed to find happiness in your own ways. To realize that it’s no small thing to keep on breathing, but still you do, in and out as the clock hand moves. No one will ever have full access to your thoughts and dreams but you, so be kind to yourself. You deserve love as much as every other person breathing on this earth. Being alone does not mean you aren’t good enough for other’s company or that you even need it. You can’t love people fully without first loving yourself.
This is the time to realize that you hold the strength to free yourself from the lies. And each day, that strength will look different, because living isn’t for the weak. Breathing and hoping aren’t for the shallow. You are allowed to mold your strength and recharge in the shadows. Understand that the stillness calls when you need it. Allow yourself time to rest a while and be reminded of your worth—It is independent of who loves you and who doesn’t, of who stands by you and who leaves you. Your worth is found in the pulse of your heart, and the air in your lungs. You don’t need another person to supply you with worth, you just need to recognize that it lives within you.
Be patient in your healing. Those years of fitting a mold won’t release their grip easily, but know that they will leave. Put your energy into finding your core and healing from that suffocation. Clear air can be found when you climb high above the lie that to be alone is to fail—the sun still shines on you regardless of who approves of you and who doesn’t. And if you can see the beauty in letting the present be what it is, then you’re already breaking free through walls of lies. Let them fall and choose their fear—you’ve always been stronger than them.",Kesehatan Mental
23,You Are Worthy Because You Exist,7/28/2021,Amy Horton,https://thoughtcatalog.com/amy-horton/2021/07/you-are-worthy-because-you-exist/,"If you have never felt loved or accepted, I am writing this for you. If you don’t know how to love yourself, I am writing this for you. If you don’t know how you fit into this judgmental, chaotic world, I am writing this for you. You are exactly as you are meant to be. You are not a mistake. You are not broken. Maybe no one has ever told you that you are enough. But you are, my love—you are more than enough. You are so worthy of your every dream, wish, and desire. You are not wrong for being who you are. The world is wrong for trying to cage you into a definable category, an acceptable algorithm in whatever these bullshit societal norms demand. And trust me, they are complete bullshit. The world is wrong, not you.
You deserve your own love and trust more than anyone else. Like most of us, you probably spread it out to everyone around you and leave nothing back for yourself. You hurt when your efforts aren’t reciprocated. You were taught that you had to earn love, that you had to give yourself away in order to be worthy of anything. That’s not true. You are allowed to be selfish with your love – in fact, it’s necessary for your survival in this predatory world. Love yourself first. Trust yourself first. Set boundaries around yourself, even though it feels scary. In the end, those who aren’t meant for you may leave. It will be painful, but you have to create space to let the right ones in. They will come. It’s hard to believe in the beginning, but once you start shining that beautiful light of yours inwards and illuminating all the darkest parts of yourself, you set yourself free. You show your true spirit to the world and your tribe will respond, drawn to your magnetism. Drawn to the unique being that you are, the bravery and truth that you represent. Your people show up when you stand in your authenticity. Until you find the courage to do so, you’ll always feel like you don’t fit in because you are attracting the wrong people. People who feed off of your giving nature. People who take you for granted and steal your precious energy. It is up to you to stop the eternal drain, to say no more, to decide that you can have better.
You deserve love. You are love. How could you not deserve it when you embody it? We are all beings of light and integrity who have simply lost our way on this journey of humanity. Our task is to come back to ourselves. Our mission is to unlearn all the conditioning and heal the trauma of our lifetimes.
Do not listen to the world. You have listened to it all along – has it done you any good? The sooner you tune in to what you want and need, the easier it is to let go of what others think. You cannot live your life for other people while they go on living for themselves. You will never win that battle. In the end, you’ll be left with nothing and they’ll tell you that you did it to yourself. They aren’t wrong – we are responsible for our choices. Stop abandoning yourself. Do whatever it is you need to do to get back to the root of your true spirit, your inherent nature.
You can be the light that you are searching for in this barren landscape. That is the only answer that will bring you what you’re craving. Everything you need is within you. Truly.
I once did not believe that. I once loathed myself and searched for others to fill the wounds, the empty unknowable spaces inside me. I felt like a gaping void of sadness all of the time, and I could not solve my problem. I could not solve it because I was endlessly, desperately looking for answers outside of myself. They never lived there, so I never found them. I had to learn to heal my own self-worth. That was the solution all along.
I’ll tell you again: You are worthy. You are enough. You are absolutely right to be exactly who you are. You deserve to live as that person without any judgment, harassment, rejection, or shame. If you exist here on this earth, you are meant to be here. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Don’t let anyone take your humanity away from you. I am here to tell you that you are loved, you are precious, and you deserve everything you ever wanted. I am here for you. I see you. You belong.",Kesehatan Mental
24,NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness): Nonprofit Guide for College Students,4/24/2023,Devin Stonerock,https://www.collegemagazine.com/nami-national-alliance-on-mental-illness-nonprofit-guide-for-college-students/,"National Alliance on Mental Illness, or NAMI, has a reputation for being one of the best sources for supporting and educating the public on mental illness. This nonprofit offers a wide array of careers, internships and volunteer opportunities for students of every major. 1 in 5 college students experience some form of mental illness, and nearly 75% of mental health conditions are diagnosed by the age of 24. Given these statistics, NAMI may be one of the most rewarding nonprofits you could choose to work for. For most intern and volunteer roles, you might not even need to leave campus.
Read on to find out more about all you can offer NAMI and NAMI can offer to you.
What We Do
NAMI started as families at their kitchen tables in 1979. These families, scattered all over the nation, were looking to help their loved ones affected by mental illness. Originally called “Parents of Adult Schizophrenics,” the movement grew and eventually created what we know today as NAMI. NAMI developed into the largest grassroots mental health organization with over 600 affiliates nationwide. Their mission is to provide “advocacy, education, support and public awareness so that all individuals and families affected by mental illness can build better lives.” They do this through various programs you can check out at their website. Once you learn about what they do, you will find it easy to follow through with support, advocacy, listening and leading.
Who We Help
NAMI offers education classes and support groups for individuals with mental health conditions and their loved ones. NAMI also educates the public on the warning signs and symptoms of mental health conditions in an effort for more people to get the help they might need. They aim to provide support to everyone, from children and parents to those who may be struggling themselves or anyone who wants to get involved. NAMI’s belief in diversity, equity and inclusion ensures that no single person who wishes to be educated or supported feels left out.
What It’s Really Like
Every role in NAMI, whether you are an employee, intern or volunteer, has its benefits and challenges. Many volunteer programs require people who experience mental illness or know a loved one that has. This can be challenging because it requires them to discuss their real-life experiences living with these situations. However, the reward is often far greater. They are often thanked for the impact they make in people’s lives simply by sharing their story for the purpose of education.
“Being an intern. It’s one of the best things that has happened to me. It started small at first. I would handle maybe one or two support groups to start. When I became more comfortable, I was able to take on more tasks and more work. Fast forward and I am now handling anywhere between two to four groups with little to no supervision. I enjoy my work as an intern, and I feel that as time passes, I will have accomplished more than I could have ever dreamt,” NAMI Florida Intern and Kent State University senior Christopher Williamson said.
Working for a nonprofit has its challenges because of budget concerns and a smaller staff. However, the rewards far outweigh these challenges. A benefit of working for a nonprofit is the passion that every employee brings to the table because they truly care. There is a lot more that can be accomplished from a place of compassion as opposed to selfish gain. It is very rewarding to know you are supporting an effort that truly makes a difference in people’s lives.
What You’ll Learn
Every role at NAMI, whether an employee, an intern or a volunteer, is an ongoing learning experience. The three most common employee roles at the state level are the Program Manager, Director of Outreach and Events and Communication Coordinator. The Program Manager deals primarily with training volunteers. The NAMI Indianapolis Director of Outreach and Events essentially takes on the PR role and oversees all internships.
“The job includes marketing our programs and events, as well as sustaining public relations efforts to spread awareness and educate the public,” NAMI Indiana Communications Coordinator Caroline Chastain said.
At the intern level, you will learn what it is like to do these in-office jobs and many other opportunities that might fit your qualifications and interest. An internship with NAMI offers the chance to learn skills valuable to future professions. They offer hands-on experience helping with projects in the office. For example, a recent intern helped establish one of their newest program efforts, NAMI in the Lobby, which sends NAMI volunteers to the waiting rooms of pediatric emergency hospitals to support families experiencing a mental health crisis. When it comes to interning, there is no limit to what you can learn. You can help educate, offer to set up events and help out in the office a few days a week.
How to Get Involved
NAMI has an array of internship opportunities and is willing to work with students to offer an experience that best suits their interests. They also train volunteers to work on their Helpline. Those who work on the Helpline are trained to listen and offer assistance to anyone who calls and needs help or someone to talk with Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. EST. They are also available by chat, text, and email. For more information about volunteering or reaching the helpline, click here.
“Someone interning with the helpline will learn about the abundance of resources in the state, while someone interning in events will learn about all the free signature programs NAMI provides for people living with a mental health condition and their loved ones. I think the biggest thing anyone that has ever interned with NAMI Indiana learned is the power of stories. Our story is powerful and brings us all together. With those stories, it allows us to end the stigma surrounding mental health,” NAMI Indiana’s Director of Outreach and Events, Richard Dixon said.
There are many opportunities to volunteer outside of employment and internship opportunities as well. NAMI also offers “NAMI on Campus,” which many students find beneficial. These are student-led, student-run mental health organizations on college campuses. The volunteers are in charge of holding support groups, candlelight vigils, finding guest speakers and spreading awareness. To find or start a “NAMI on Campus” club at your university.

25,Supporting Student Mental Health,2/13/2023,George Philip (GP) LeBourdais,https://www.collegeconfidential.com/articles/supporting-student-mental-health/,"How Passion Projects, Positive Storytelling and Portfolios Can Encourage Resilience
The following is an excerpt from Polygence’s white paper Paths to Resilience. Download the full article below to learn more about how passion projects can support resilience and improved mental health.
Key Takeaways
1.	Young people are experiencing an ongoing crisis of mental health.
2.	Embracing passions and telling positive stories about ourselves is a proven way to combat emotional challenges and develop resilience.
3.	Practicing self reflection by writing essays or building portfolios can help students find meaning beyond their academic achievements.
The State of the Youth Mental Health Crisis
In January 2020, researchers from Yale University published an alarming report about the mental state of US secondary students.
The nationwide survey of 21,768 high schoolers from Yale’s Center for Emotional Intelligence and the Child Study Center discovered a large majority–nearly 75%–had negative feelings about their time at school. “It was higher than we expected,” said co-author and research scientist Zorana Ivcevic about the results. “We know from talking to students that they are feeling tired, stressed, and bored, but were surprised by how overwhelming it was.”
In hindsight, these findings may seem trivial next to the emotional and physical impact of Covid-19, which warped the entire world in the following months and years. The public health effects continue to be dizzying, but students have suffered acutely. In October 2021, alarmed by “soaring rates of mental health challenges among children, adolescents, and their families,” the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Children’s Hospital Association jointly declared a “state of national emergency.”
And yet as coronavirus closures ebb more than two years later and something resembling pre-pandemic school returns, stress, anxiety, and depression still affect secondary students at epidemic levels. Things did not improve in 2022. A New York Times survey of school counselors across the country this spring found that nearly all of them (94%) reported that students were showing more signs of anxiety and depression than before the pandemic.
Yet while student stressors have worsened over the past few years, the root causes of them clearly run deeper than Covid and remote schooling. The rise in stress correlates with steadily decreasing acceptance rates at top schools. In 2011, a student applying to Ivies might have considered the University of Chicago a safety school with a 34.9% acceptance rate; its admission rate last year was 6%.
The pressure to gain acceptance to a good college can turn academic life toxic; students from high-achieving schools “suffer from symptoms of clinical depression at rates three to seven times higher than normal”. For their part, schools, districts, and colleges have grasped the urgent need for increased counseling support and mental health resources. However, staffing shortages often force them to triage students in crisis before attending to subclinical individuals who need more modest interventions. Which leaves us to ask: What can be done on a pedagogical level to address these issues? What changes to the structure or goals of academic work could make students more resilient and fulfilled?
In a white paper analyzing Harvard admissions data, researchers at Polygence.org established how research and passion projects enhance college applications. We now turn our attention to the personal and psychological values of such work, namely how engaging in projects can have a tangible impact on academic success and emotional well-being.
One of many serious psychological tolls of the pandemic is the sense that we no longer have control over our lives. Covid has disempowered us in many ways. Political clashes around public health mandates are one expression of this frustration, but so is the tattered fabric of academic life. Sweeping changes to standardized testing, for instance, upended the way many high school students prepared for college applications. And though eliminating SAT requirements could help thousands of U.S. colleges usher in new levels of racial and socioeconomic diversity, it has also worsened a sense that admissions decisions are unpredictable and arbitrary. How can students put their best foot forward when the grounds for judgment are themselves unstable?
Responding well to these changes is perhaps the definition of resilience, known in psychology as the process of adapting to adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats or significant sources of stress. And research has shown that building resilience depends in large part on mindset. For her Polygence project on Coping during Covid-19, Isabel Wang explored a psychological concept known as the Locus of Control (LOC) in a survey of fellow high school students. The results, which earned Wang recognition as a Regeneron Science Competition winner, were both intuitive and eye-opening. Wang’s data suggested that students who have a high internal LOC–meaning that they believe their own decisions guide life outcomes–coped much better with the ever-changing ambiguities of Covid than those with a high external LOC, who thought external events dictated their outcomes.
Other research supports Wang’s findings. In a broad survey of students during lockdown, the research arm of the textbook and tutoring company Chegg found that 53% of high school students said they were “moderately,” “very,” or “extremely” worried about their mental health. One third reported experiencing depression, and almost a quarter (24%) said they knew of someone with suicidal thoughts. As these numbers suggest, the external forces that dominated adolescent life during Covid–from public health protocols, to changing school rules, the suspension of whole athletic seasons, restrictions on socializing, etc.–can severely erode internal LOC, and by extension our ability to cope with challenges.
It’s for good reason, then, that experts in curriculum design and administration have advocated for changes that put the power of decision back into the hands of students. Recent advice from Cathy Vattertot and the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development endorsed, among other things, giving students “more autonomy in learning” and “control over their time.” This advice is logical; for students to feel they control their future paths, they must have final say in which direction to go.
For their part, mental health professionals can also help young people to develop skills that can improve their overall mood and happiness, especially through activities that are personally meaningful to them. As Clinical Psychotherapist Michelle Terry has written, “Teens are increasingly searching for and engaging in positive outlets to manage mental health. By doing so, they are demonstrating an impressive ability and desire to be their own best advocates and active participants in their mental health and well-being.” As her own daughter demonstrated through research on the power of dance therapy in adolescent mental health, projects that tap into a young person’s passions can play a powerful role in supporting positive academic and emotional outcomes.
“Parents always ask me, ‘What’s the number one ingredient to set my children up for success?’ I always say self-confidence…A strong sense of self and importantly self-confidence will empower young adults to find and nurture their passions. For me, there’s nothing better than watching my clients realize their full potential by acting on their passions and making a positive impact on others.”
Results from our research mentorship program at Polygence provides an example of how passion projects like these can also improve student emotional perceptions of school and their academic trajectories. Responses to a post-program Academic Outlook survey of more than 1,000 alumni indicated the experience made them feel more empowered and optimistic on several fronts. 84% agree or strongly agree that doing an independent project helped them feel more in control of their education, and the same percentage said (agree or strongly agree) that their mentor helped them feel more optimistic about their academic future. These sentiments are likely driven not just by personal connections but by the acquisition of tangible skills. 73% of Polygence alumni strongly agreed that their project let them do things they wouldn’t have had the chance to do in school, and 88% found that things they learned on their independent projects would help or have already helped them succeed in college.
It’s worth noting that these students did not select specific courses or even follow predetermined curricula when working with mentors. They received no grades for their work and had flexible deadlines. Each topic was identified by the individual student as something they cared about and the development of the project revolved around their own goals and self assessment. While there are merits to other pedagogical models as well, empowering students to control their own explorations at appropriate times has many positive outcomes.",Kesehatan Mental
26,Why Are Young People So Miserable?,10/11/2022,Alvin Powell,https://www.collegeconfidential.com/articles/young-people-are-unhappy/,"Young People Tally Lowest Life-Satisfaction Scores Among All Age Groups in a Harvard-Led Study
""Across every dimension of well-being that we looked at — happiness, health, meaning, character, relationships, financial stability ... those who are 18 to 25 felt they were worse off,"" said Tyler VanderWeele about a new study he authored.
Twenty years ago, life satisfaction surveys of those 18 and older showed the highest readings among America’s younger and older adults, with those in between struggling with jobs, families, and other cares of middle life. Now, a Harvard-led study examining a dozen measures of well-being show younger adults tallying the lowest scores of any age group. Tyler VanderWeele, director of the Human Flourishing Program at Harvard’s Institute for Quantitative Social Science and senior author of the study, said the results reflect not just a longer-standing mental health crisis among younger Americans that predates and was worsened by the pandemic, but a broader crisis in which they perceive not just their mental but also their physical health, social connectedness, and other measures of flourishing as worse than other age groups. VanderWeele, the John L. Loeb and Frances Lehman Loeb Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said that should grab policymakers’ attention.
Q&A: Tyler VanderWeele
GAZETTE: Clearly, they’re related, but how is well-being different from mental health?
VANDERWEELE: Obviously, mental health is important. It is important to address issues of anxiety, depression, trauma, suicidality for youth and for adults. Having said that, I think we’ve neglected broader questions of well-being or flourishing that I understand in very holistic terms as living in a state in which all aspects of one’s life are good. That takes into account mental health, physical health, and — more broadly — happiness, having a sense of meaning and purpose, trying to be a good person, one’s social relationships, and the financial, material conditions that sustain these things that people care about.
GAZETTE: The report compares results of a survey earlier this year against a similar study in 2000. What did that survey show about our state of well-being 22 years ago?
VANDERWEELE: A number of studies had found those who were younger and those who were older — if you just looked at happiness and life satisfaction — tended to be doing better than those in the middle. The speculation was that those in midlife were struggling more, dealing with young children, maybe also aging parents. Maybe they were at a point in their careers where they were trying to get ahead, possibly even having a midlife crisis. For those who were younger, the statistics from past decades suggested they were happier, maybe with a sense of greater opportunity, fewer responsibilities, more opportunities for social connection.
What was perhaps surprising in earlier surveys was that those who were older were also doing better than those in middle age. Though health problems often emerge with age, people were still happier. Maybe they felt that the struggles of life were resolved, or they had more time to connect socially. There’s also some evidence of greater emotional regulation as one ages, greater gratitude for what has taken place. These are averages, obviously, that disguise a lot of variability, but this curve was fairly consistently observed across countries.
GAZETTE: What did you find in your most recent survey?
VANDERWEELE: We were beginning to see this in January 2020, right before the pandemic. But January 2022 was the first time it was just absolutely clear: across every dimension of well-being that we looked at — happiness, health, meaning, character, relationships, financial stability — each one was strictly increasing with age. Those who are 18 to 25 felt they were worse off across all these dimensions. It was pretty striking, pretty disturbing.
GAZETTE: One thing that stood out to me was that it was true even for physical health. You’d think that would be a lay-up for young people. How do we explain that?
VANDERWEELE: It is powerful. Young people perceive themselves as not being physically healthy. One has to take into account the context of January 2022: We’re still in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic; Omicron has rendered social and communal interactions — once again — very difficult shortly after there was hope that things would be opening up. Some of this may thus be a sense of physical threat from the pandemic affecting young people more than others. Some of it may be a sense that they’re not engaging in the health behaviors that young people think they should be. Perhaps drug and alcohol use were up. It might be a discrepancy between experience and expectations. As a 24-year-old, perhaps here’s how I think I should feel physically, and I am just not there. So, all of those things likely come into play, but it is striking — shocking in some ways — that this group’s self-reported physical health was so low.
GAZETTE: Loneliness was another area called out in the study.
VANDERWEELE: Social connectedness was reported to be lowest in this group. Taking into account the timing, it’s probably not so surprising. There was prior evidence that young adults had been increasing in loneliness, and I think that was really accentuated by the pandemic. What we saw in the pandemic was that, on average, in the United States the sense of social connectedness went down a little bit, and loneliness went up a little bit, though not as much as one might have anticipated. Many people invested more in their families and their close friends, they connected via Zoom or other media with relatives. But the decline was substantial among young people. Those who are older had established relationships and established communities that they could draw upon, but young people at that stage in life are trying to build these relationships and trying to join these communities, and the opportunities to do so were so much more limited.
GAZETTE: Do we have any sense as to causes? Social media has been called out as a villain. The economy?
VANDERWEELE: The data we’re working with at present is purely descriptive. It doesn’t allow us to get at causes. But piecing together evidence from other studies, one can begin to understand what might be happening. Some of it is financial and economic. Job prospects for young people, in terms of the advancement that was foreseeable and anticipated 40 to 50 years ago, are just not there to the same degree. Debt from education has been weighing heavily on young people. Housing costs in cities are skyrocketing, while studies suggest that the majority of Gen Z wants to own a home but thinks it’s absolutely out of reach.
I think social media has contributed to declines in well-being. Past studies indicate that on average, the effects on well-being and mental health are negative, especially in those with high use. And high use is dramatically more common with young adults than others. Also, study after study — ours and others’ — have indicated that family life and participation in religious communities contribute across these aspects of flourishing. And participation in both of those are down substantially.
I think political polarization has had a role in this also. Many people feel: “How can I live in a country like this, where half the people are terrible?” Plus, the last five years have been a pretty turbulent time: the pandemic, Russia and Ukraine, concerns about climate change. We’re all confronting this, but older people have had longer periods of relative stability than those in their 20s. The world probably seems like a more threatening place.
GAZETTE: Are there any hints about a path ahead?
VANDERWEELE: Again, not from the survey responses itself, but perhaps from other studies that we and others have done. It’s pretty clear that these domains of well-being are interrelated. If you improve on social relationships, you’re also more likely to subsequently improve on happiness and health and to find meaning. If you have a sense of meaning, find new purpose, you’re likely to become happier and also have better health as well. So we need to work on each of these aspects: We need to promote relationships and communities; we need to address the financial conditions that young people are facing; we need to help them find systems of meaning. We do need to address mental health issues, questions of anxiety and depression, but just doing that isn’t going to be enough. The problem is much broader.
We also need to think about economic and health policy. To what extent are we thinking about the common good, not just across political lines but across generational lines? Not just what’s going to help us in the next three to five years, but that will shape future generations? We found larger differences across age groups than across groups defined by either gender or race. How can we structure society so that young people have opportunities, and so that their well-being is promoted? How do we get there from here? I don’t have all the answers, but it is a pretty important we take this seriously.

100,I'm Bipolar,11/23/2017,Mary McGee (she/her),https://marymcgee8.medium.com/im-bipolar-8c3dba0af897,"It is really important for me to be authentic. I have recently started sharing stuff on social media about suffering from depression and anxiety, along with a laundry list of other issues. I know that a lot of people think that what I am sharing is negative and social media is typically an outlet for people to post all the amazing things going on in their lives. That is great, but I am not always sunshine and rainbows all day. I do not want to be fake with people, so I like to share a little part of what is going on in my life, whether it is the good, the bad, or the ugly.

As many of you know, I have been searching for something to alleviate my symptoms, whether it is meds or supplements or eating quinoa for breakfast every day. In September of this year, I gave up meds after my last bad reaction to Effexor, went to a natural doctor, started eating healthier and taking 15+ supplements per day. I also started trying to do the things that are important for me to do, but are a major struggle for me to do on a daily basis because of my depression. I started spending more time with friends instead of isolating myself. I started going to the gym. I started getting more involved with student affairs stuff. I was making a positive change in my life, and I thought I was getting better because I was doing all of these great things to change my life.

I remember sitting down in counseling and telling my counselor that I was doing really well. I was doing AMAZING, sleeping two hours a night because I was so productive, was super happy and social and all the things that depressed Mary is not. I was excited, because happy was not something that I had felt for more than a couple moments for the past ten years. Ten years is a long time, folks. I have received so much negative feedback from medical professionals in the past year, including moving on from depression because it is a broken leg that can be fixed with therapy and meds. I was also told that I had treatment resistant depression and that I had failed meds. I really hate that phrase, because it is literally not my fault that none of these meds worked for me. I felt like people were putting all the blame on me, but I was actively trying to get better.

I felt like something else was going on. I wanted to get tested for everything possible, because my gut told me that something else was wrong. I was hunting for thyroid issues or something else that could explain why none of the meds worked and why counseling was not all that beneficial. I didnt think that in a couple months, I should be sitting in a chair across from a psychiatrist telling them that I thought I was bipolar.

My first hypomanic episode happened in October. I thought that all of my meds had flushed out of my system, so I finally was not ideating suicide and staring at the wall for hours on end. One of the main symptoms that I watch out for is extreme amounts of energy, because I generally am tired minutes after waking up if I am depressed. I felt like another person, because I was not tired and I was spending all this time with friends. I was super social, giggly, and happy. Like for days. I never experience that. I was excited because I thought that all my hard work had FINALLY paid off.

Unfortunately, two weeks later I came down from the highs that hypomania brings. I laid in bed for four days wondering what had happened to me. I was back to staring at the white walls for hours on end, skipping class, being unproductive, sad, tired, and lonely all the time. My counselor told me that maybe I had a good two weeks, but I was not buying it. I knew something else was going on. I recovered after giving myself four days straight of being in bed with a depression coma.

Things got better again, and I was excited. When I am hypomanic, everything is AMAZING and I love everyone and I become this crazy, extroverted social butterfly. In a way, hypomania truly is AMAZING, because it gives you this peek at what life could be like if you were not depressed. Coming down from hypomania, though, is another story. Nothing is worse than coming down from hypomania. It feels hopeless and makes me feel like nothing will ever get better. It feels like Im losing myself, the happy self that I crave so badly, and all the walls are tumbling down around me. It makes me feel like theres no point in trying to get better, because it feels like the lights will be off forever.

I was hypomanic at a student affairs conference recently. It is not obvious to people if I am hypomanic, unless you know me extremely well. I seem almost normal when I am hypomanic. I can not stop talking, laughing, and smiling. People loved hypomanic Mary at the conference. Multiple schools approached me about attending their graduate programs, and I was confident for the first time in a long time. This is why I describe hypomania as awesome and amazing, but in reality, it makes me worry if people will like depressed Mary or if I will ever be stable enough to work a full-time job where I cant take three or four days off to lay in bed and recover from a hypomanic episode.

After my second episode, I realized that what was going on was bipolar II disorder. Bipolar II is different than bipolar I in terms of how it is presented. Bipolar II usually is written off as depression (same as my story) and takes so long to diagnose. Bipolar II is less severe, but feels so hard to control. People with bipolar disorder have a much higher rate of suicide, which scares me a lot. 1 in 5 people will commit suicide.

I walked into the psychiatrist is office and declared that I thought I was bipolar II. I did not feel invincible or like I was off the rails, I was just the opposite of depressed Mary for once. I had all this energy, was not angry/irritable/depressed all the time, slept very little, was super confident, social, and outgoing. Then I would go through a period where I transitioned to being comatose with depression for a while.

This diagnosis was not exactly what I was hoping for. I had been searching for something that was an easier fix, something easier than tackling mental illness. I have cried about this every night since being diagnosed six days ago. It feels hopeless and cruel. I have had anxiety about losing friends over this. I have had anxiety about being able to hold a future job. I have been worried about my quality of life, too. I have worried about finding a significant other in the future that can handle me throughout the roller coaster that is mental illness. In a way, this diagnosis feels like just another obstacle that will take me the majority of my life to conquer. It is hard to be hopeful about something that is so crippling. I have not even been able to figure out depression, and I have had that for ten years.

Something I have really been thinking about is the stigma of mental illness, especially bipolar disorder. I do not know a single person that has openly spoken about having bipolar disorder, and that is really isolating. I appreciate that people are finally talking about mental illness, but we need to dig a lot deeper into the harder to talk about issues. I am not crazy and I do not generally appear unstable in person, but I am really struggling because that is what people see bipolar disorder as. I really need support. The community is there, but it seems really difficult to find.

Unfortunately, I have to be ready to put the work in with tracking my moods, triggers, and symptoms. I started meds again two days ago after not responding to any SSRIs positively. Fun fact, SSRIs can produce mania in people that have not been diagnosed with bipolar disorder yet. There is a huge learning curve, and the things I am learning are not exactly promising. Life has not ever been easy for me, and I am trying to figure out how to be patient and hang in here, even when I do not want to.",Kesehatan Mental
27,Other People's Perceptions of Me Trigger Negative Thoughts,5/1/2023,Laura A. Barton,https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs/recoveringfrommentalillness/2023/5/other-peoples-perceptions-of-me-trigger-negative-thoughts,"Do you know that saying that other people’s opinions of you are none of your business? As much as I try to keep that in my head, that’s easier said than followed, and other people's perceptions of me trigger negative thoughts.
Other People's Perceptions: I Don't Care If People Like Me, But I Also Kind of Do
Let me start by saying I don’t care if people don’t like me. I really don’t. I’m not everyone’s cup of tea, and that’s fine. 
At the same time, there is still some part of me that wants to be liked, which makes it difficult for me when I learn someone has a negative perception of me. Especially when I don’t think it’s accurate.
I’ve never been the kind of person with a lot of friends. Much of my life has been spent trying to reason out why that is when society says it should be otherwise. When I can’t reason it out, I turn inwards.
It leads me down the path of negative thoughts, such as how there must be something wrong with me and how I must be a bad person. It’s hard to think of anything else when society repeatedly feeds us the idea that we should have wide social circles and swaths of people who love us.
Thus, while I don’t care if people like me, I also kind of do.
Challenging Negative Thoughts Around Other People's Perceptions Is a Part of Recovery
This has been on my mind because I recently learned there are people in a community I’m a part of who see me as arrogant and stuck up. I see myself as anything but, so I was taken aback, and immediately my negative thoughts started churning. What could I have done to cause this perception in other people? What’s wrong with me that this is how they see me?
I eventually circled around to how it could be because I’m a big introvert, quiet, and have social anxiety. While those people probably know none of that, especially the mental illness part, I see it as a logical explanation because it keeps me to myself, which could lead people to see me in that light. The “resting b**** face” I also seem to have probably doesn’t help.
You know what, though? It’s not my fault people see me that way. It’s not my fault people take the face value (no pun intended) and assume that’s the reality without ever having a conversation with me.
With that in mind, it’s a matter of challenging my negative thoughts about other people's perceptions of me (and society’s idea of the human experience) as I continue on my path of mental health recovery. It’s a lesson I’m still learning, but I think it’ll ultimately be a lesson well worth learning. At the very least, I’m willing to give it a try.

28,My Medication Throughout Treatment Changed,4/27/2023,Cherly Wozny,https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs/verbalabuseinrelationships/2023/4/my-medication-throughout-treatment-changed,"You can still find a negative stigma around mental health and medication treatment for many individuals. How others perceive them with the knowledge that they use pharmaceuticals can be negative. However, there is not one right answer, and medication treatment needs can change significantly throughout the healing process when recovering from verbal abuse. 

I Had Varying Medication Treatment Needs as I Healed
Of course, not everyone will benefit from medication treatment when facing a long road of recovery from a verbally abusive rela. I found pharmaceuticals to provide the relief I needed as I healed from my situation, although they did change during my recovery process. 

Sometimes other life events arise that can intensify the healing journey of someone facing verbal abuse. During these stressful times, medication needs may vary to assist an individual more effectively. In contrast, there were times when my doctor and I decided that my medication dose could be lower. 

Several life events, including a death in my family, called for my medication to be higher while I managed a less-than-ideal situation. Alternatively, when I became pregnant with my last child, I made the decision to stop medication until after the birth. 

Monitoring Changing Medication Treatment Needs
When taking medication for any reason, having a medical professional oversee your treatment plan is vital. There may be times in your life when you need to alter the amount for optimal results. Taking control of your life and mental health includes monitoring your changing medication treatment needs. 

Some methods I used to monitor my medication through recovery included: 

Keeping a daily mood journal
Monitoring any side effects
Talking to my therapist regularly 
Visiting my doctor to discuss my medication dose
Checking in with my family and friends 
Although your family doctor will know which medication treatment is best for you, family and friends can lend insight into how well it is working. My husband and close friends were excellent resources as I managed my life away from verbal abuse. These people could provide honest feedback on how effective my medication was for me from their perspective. 

It's critical that you discuss any medication treatment changes with your doctor or healthcare professional first. These individuals can guide you on the side effects and help you navigate medication choices as you heal. Not all pharmaceutical options will work for everyone, so your healthcare specialist will help you with your choices. ","Kesehatan Mental, Pengalaman Pribadi"
29,Eating Disorder Treatments that Didn't Work for Me,10/20/2020,Hollay Ghadery,https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs/survivinged/2020/10/eating-disorder-treatments-that-didnt-work-for-me,"Eating disorders are deadly but also treatable mental illnesses. Still, in my early struggle to recover, there were many common eating disorder treatments that didn't work for me. Understand, I am not saying that they don't work for anyone. On the contrary, they work for countless people who suffer. This said, there is no one road to recovery, and I write this blog post in the hopes of inspiring people who haven't had any luck with traditional eating disorder treatments to keep going.
Standard Eating Disorder Treatments
The most common eating disorder treatments that I encountered during my initial stages of recovery included psychotherapy, medications, and nutrition education. These were also the options presented to me by my doctor. I tried them all, and while I found parts of them valuable, ultimately, I discovered that I couldn't handle them: I did not want to talk about my eating disorder. I tried therapy and left every session wanting to eat and binge more than ever. 
I did not want to talk about nutrition. I was a certified personal trainer, and nutrition specialist for a decade and logically, I knew how to eat properly; I just wasn't doing it. Just like doctors who smoke, you don't always do what you know is best for you.
I didn't want to take medications. I was trying to recover from an alcohol addiction that was also sliding into a dependence on pharmaceuticals. They were prescribed pharmaceuticals, but they were sedatives, nevertheless, and I was not using them wisely.
I've spoken in this post about how I recovered, and in the end, it boiled down to relentless self-care and putting myself first, always. I also wrote a book about my eating disorder. That's right: I wrote a whole book about it. Granted, some of this book was written while I was still very much in the clutches of my disorder, but writing about my experience helped give me clarity and a level of honesty and introspection I don't think I could have ever gained by talking to someone else or taking medications. Writing through my eating disorder helped me pick out connections I would never have otherwise realized because I would not have been open enough to admit certain things about myself and my life to anyone else.
Finding Your Best Eating Disorder Treatment
Of course, writing a book is not going to be everyone’s preferred eating disorder treatment, but that’s precisely my point: your treatment should reflect who you are and what makes you tick. For some, therapy works wonders, and medication is a saving grace. For some, being educated on how to properly fuel their bodies is a missing link, and gives them the knowledge we all need to support a healthy recovery.
I think any way you can recover healthfully is a great way to recover. Don’t feel too pressured by what you think you should be doing and, instead, ask yourself how you think you'll best be supported. As long as you are moving toward recovery, any step in the right direction is a good one.

30,Cerita Mini : Suara yang Menumbangkan Malam,11/27/2018,Roem Adi,https://medium.com/@sangpendekarhati_8652/cerita-mini-suara-yang-menumbangkan-malam-baab9786e631,"Aroma wangi yang ganjil tercium menyentak hidung. Pintu-pintu rumah dikunci, ditutup rapat. Para ibu segera merengkuh anak-anaknya, memeluk sambil diam.
Bayang-bayang merah belumlah menghilang benar dari cakrawala. Sesaat setelah cahaya remang itu perlahan menghilang, tak ada seorang manusia pun keluar rumah, meski hanya seorang bocah yang tak memiliki rasa takut. Tetapi kampung itu sudah sedemikian sepi. Jalanan lengang, bahkan anak-anak sudah sepekan ini tak ada yang berani keluar rumah. Biasanya suara mereka memecah malam. Ditemani bapak dan ibu mereka yang bercakap-cakap di pelataran rumah. Teh, kopi, wedang jahe, biasanya menemani mereka bercengkerama. Sesekali terdengar tawa berderai.
Semua bermula sejak sepekan lalu. Seorang perempuan ditemukan gantung diri di dalam rumah yang terletak di sudut desa. Penyebabnya belum diketahui. Masyarakat di sana terpecah menjadi suara. Antara memakamkan perempuan itu dengan layak atau dibiarkan begitu saja? Mereka yang berpendapat perempuan itu tak layak diurus, dimakamkan pun percuma, rohnya akan gentayangan, tak ada bumi yang menerima manusia yang mati dengan mengakhiri hidupnya sendiri. Yang tak sependapat, mengatakan dia juga manusia. Sama seperti kita. Perlakukanlah dia sebagaimana manusia memperlakukan manusia meski ia sudah mati. Adu argumentasi itu tak memiliki ujung pangkal. Kedua belah pihak merasa paling benar. Akhirnya diputuskan, siapa yang menyolati dan menguburkan tetap menghormati perempuan itu. Mereka yang tidak ikut mengurus jenazah perempuan itu, mengolok mereka yang menyolatinya.
Pada malam berikutnya, terdengar kikik menggoda namun mengerikan. Membuat bulu kuduk meremang. Awalnya mereka acuh. Tapi lama-kelamaan mereka terusik. Mereka disergap sejenis ketakutan yang tak terjelaskan. Malam kedua mereka berkumpul untuk mencari dimana asal suara. Mereka hanya menemukan keheningan. Suara itu menggema di angkasa. Menggetarkan seluruh urat nadi yang ada dalam diri manusia. Degup jantung laiknya seseorang yang terguncang menyerang. Mereka hanya bisa menutup rapat pintu rumah mereka. Mendekap anaknya dengan erat, berharap anak-anak lelap tanpa dicekam bayangan mengerikan.

31,4 Pengalaman Mistis (atau mungkin Parno Saja) yang Saya Alami Sepanjang Hidup,10/24/2021,Aji Pratama,https://ajipratama.medium.com/4-pengalaman-mistis-atau-mungkin-parno-saja-yang-saya-alami-sepanjang-hidup-1bf3e696b378,"Mahkluk tak kasat mata itu ada dan saya percaya keberadaannya, di ajaran agama saya sendiri hal semacam itu juga dianggap Ada, Jin.
Latar belakang
Saya lahir dan tumbuh di salah satu desa di Jawa Tengah, desa ini masih banyak sawah, ladang, kebon dan bahkan di banyak titik masih ada Hutan Kecil (Forrest). Banyak saya dengar pengalaman mistis dari lingkungan sekitar teman-teman, tetangga, kearabat di berbagai tempat dan keadaan selama saya hidup di sana.
Namun desa saya juga tidak terlalu pelosok, masih sangat terjangkau dari kota-kota yang dekat dengan fasilitas publik yang lumayan ramai. Dengan Pusat Kota Karanganyar, Jawa Tengah hanya sekitar 11 km atau 15 menit perjalan, ke pusat kota Sukohaharjo juga hanya sekitar 20km-an, pun ke Solo hanya sekitar 25km-an. Jadi bisa dibilang desa saya masih tergolong mudah akses. Masa kecil saya dipenuhi dengan ngebolang ke alam, ke kebon, hutan kecil, sungai, dll. Saya seperti anak desa kebanyakan.
Di daerah saya masih banyak orang yang percaya klenik, tapi keluarga saya termasuk salah satu yang sudah meninggalkan klenik, meskipun mbah dan om saya masih percaya perhitungan Astronomi Jawa, tapi kami tidak menggunakan jimat/dukun, dll. Keluarga kami dapat pengaruh modernisasi dari Muhammadiyah jadi meninggalkan hal-hal klenik, disamping itu adalah dosa yang sangat besar.
Jika dibandingkan dengan kerabat, teman-teman atau tetangga, saya termasuk orang yang paling sedikit mengalami hal-hal mistis, dan termasuk yang paling skeptis (terlepas saya mempercayai hal ghaib itu memang ada).
Cerita yang akan saya bagikan mungkin sangat tidak seram, bahkan bagi sebagian orang akan menganggap ini hanya parno-nya saya saja. Tapi saya sepenuh hati yakin bahwa yang saya alami memang bukan keparnoan semata alias benar-benar layak saya anggap sebagai pengalaman mistis.
1. Sosok Putih Melintas di belakang
Tahun 2005/2006 Waktu itu saya masih SD sekitar kelas 4 atau 5, kelas kami ada mata pelajaran olahraga dan seperti biasa kalau ada kelas olahraga maka seluruh kelas kami akan menuju Lapangan desa yang jaraknya sekitar 700m, di perjalanan itu kami melewati jembatan sungai, ladang dan pemakaman.
Pagi hari sekitar jam 8an kami berjalan bergerombol tapi terpisah, katakanlah ada 4 orang berjalan bersama, kemudian selisih beberapa meter 8 orang menyusul, dan seterusnya.
Ketika melintas pemakaman saya berjalan paling akhir di antara salah satu rombongan dan ketika melewati pemakaman sekitar 20m/30m setelah pemakaman saya melihat (ketika saya menoleh kiri kanan, dst) sosok putih berjalan menyebrang jalan dibelakang saya sangat cepat saya tidak begitu jelas karena kepala saya ngehadap kedepan dan seketika saya reflek lalu menoleh kebelakang, ketika menoleh kebelakang tidak ada apa-apa. Tapi saya yakin betul sosok putih itu melintas.
2. Suara Menangis
Ini adalah pengalaman mistis paling epic yang pernah saya alami seumur hidup. Kejadian ini terjadi ketika saya masih SD (saya lupa mungkin sekitar kelas 5 atau 6)
Jadi rumah saya itu, sebelah timur ada rumah hanya sekitar 10m tapi sebelah barat itu tidak ada rumah yang berbatasan langsung hanya ada kolam, memudian sawah, baru ada rumah setelah 150m. Seperti rumah di desa-desa gitulah, renggang.
Saya kan hanya tinggal bertiga dengan Mbah Putri dan Mbah Kakung karena ditinggal merantau Orang Tua dan adik-adik saya. Waktu itu sekitar ba’da Maghrib, jam 6.30an lah. Kebetulan kedua Mbah saya sedang ada urusan keluar. Saya ditinggal sendiri, karena biasanya memang sering ditinggal sendiri, dan seumur-umur aman-aman saja tidak ada masalah.
Nhah setelah beberapa menit saya ditinggal sendiri saya mendengar sangat sangat sangat jelas suara anak kecil menangis “Heeeu heeeeu heeeu“” awalnya saya aga bertanya-tanya itu suara kambing atau suara anak ya. Tapi setelah mikir saya yakin betul itu adalah suara anak. Suaranya sangat jelas, sampai-sampai saya keluar rumah untuk duduk di pinggir jalan, karena paling tidak kalau di luar rumah ada orang yang kadang lewat.
Setelah beberapa waktu kan saya ingin ke dalam lagi buat nonton TV, akhirnya saya masuk, dan suara itu masih terdengar sangat jelas, saya benar benar merinding sampai akhirnya saya besarkan suara TV berharap tidak menderngar suara itu lagi. Sampai akhirnya suara itu hilang sendirinya sampai kedua Mbah saya pulang.
Saya tidak tahu ada apa di sebelah barat rumah saya, tapi satu hal yang saya tahu, mba Buyut saya meninggal tenggelam di kolam.
Pengalaman ini hanya terjadi seumur hidup saya selama tinggal di sana.
3. Sampah Dibakar
Kejadian ini terjadi sekitar tahun 2011 di rumah saya kamar mandi itu terletak di belakang rumah utama dan bisa dibilang terisolir, kamar mandi tersebut masih terbuat dari gedek/kerjaninan bambu dan pintunya terbuat dari kayu ala-ala yang tidak tertutup rapat.
Waktu itu saya mau Sholat, saya ke kamar mandi buat ambil Wudhu dan setelah selesai ambil wudhu saya mau ke tempat Sholat namun saya melihat di sebelah barat ada sangkrah (sampah daun kering) terbakar, padahal hanya ada 2 orang yang biasanya membakar sampah dan itu adalah Mbah Putri dan Mbah Kakung, namun saya yakin tidak ada orang yang membakar sampah tersebut mengingat keduanya sedang sibuk mengurusi persiapan pernikahan Om saya.
Di saat saya melihat sangkarh itu saya kepapasan dengan Mbah Kakung, kebetulan Embah saya mau ambil wudhu dan saya pun tanya ke embah “Mbah kae sangkrah sing bakar sopo?” (mbah itu sampah yang bakar siapa?) lalu mbah saya keheranan beliau hening sejenak, kemudian beliau bilang “Karepe, malah meneri, wes ben.” (Yaudah malah bagus, biarin).
Karena saya penasaran saya amati apa betul ngga ada orang. Dan setelah beberap waktu saya amati saya yakin betul memang tidak ada orang di sana dan tidak pernah ada orang sejarahnya orang lain iseng membakar sampah di rumah kami selain kedua mbah saya.
4. Pindah Rumah
Setelah sekian tahun sejak 2011 saya belum pernah mengalami hal mistis lagi tapi baru bulan Agustus 2021 kemarin mengalami ini.
Jadi saya kan pindahan dan menyewa sebuah rumah di salah satu perumahan di Cikarang, perumahan ini sebenernya termasuk padat, tapi di samping kiri rumah, rumahnya kosong tidak berpenghuni dan banyak tanaman merambat, di samping kanan ada rumah yang berpenghuni.
Rumah ini sebenernya hanya kosong sekitar 3 bulan menurut tetangga yang saya tanya, meskipun ketika saya tanya pemilik rumah katanya baru kosong sebulan. 2hari sebelum menempati, kami bersih-bersih rumah tersebut selama 2 hari penuh, membersihkan banyak hal, mulai dari lantai kamat mandi. Tidak terjadi apa-apa.
Sampai akhirnya di malam pertama saya tidur ada suara gedok-gedok sangat keras di belakang rumah, beberapa waktu diam namun beberapa waktu ada lagi, kejadian itu berulang beberapa kali. Hingga akhirnya saya menyerah dan memutuskan kembali ke rumah Orang Tua.
Meskipun tetangga bilang itu kucing saya masih saja ketakutan dan memutuskan untuk batal menghuni rumah tersebut dan saya minta uang sewa saya kembali dikurangi 1 bulan padahal rumahnya sudah saya bersihkan. Tidak apa-apa saya ikhlas dan memutuskan pindah.
Kejadian ini mungkin yang paling tidak seram kerena belum jelas apakah itu hal mistis atau benar kata tetangga itu hanya kucing. Namun karena saya sudah terlanjur Parno akhirnya saya menyerah.
Penutup
Saya yakin di luar saya banyak orang punya kisahnya soal hal-hal mistis seperti ini. Sebenernya secara teori mahkluk-mahkluk tersebut tidaklah mengancam nyawa (yang saya alami). Tapi mungkin karena didikan dari kecil disuguhi film-film TV Horror dan juga cerita dari teman-teman makanya hal ini menakutkan bagi saya.
Seperti yang saya katakan di atas, saya sendiri termasuk orang paling skeptis di lingkungan saya, masih ada beberapa hal yang tidak saya ceritakan di sini karena skeptis saya tadi apakah itu adalah hal mistis atau hanya hal lain yang lebih aktual macam suara tikus, angin, dll. Namun 4 cerita tersebut merupakan cerita yang paling saya yakini bahwa itu adalah hal mistis.
Bagaimana denganmu? Apakah kamu punya cerita mistis dalam hidupmu?

32,Target Baru?,2/27/2018,tyx,https://medium.com/@tyxic/target-baru-5b7e0a8ee179,"Aku baru saja ingin menganggu Nephellium ketika kulihat dua sosok hitam berdiri di depan pagar tua itu.

“Rumah ini lagi?” Kudengar salah satu di antara kedua sosok hitam itu bertanya, mau apa mereka?

“Apa tidak ada yang lain?” Sosok hitam yang berdiri di sebelah kiri kembali bertanya kepada teman di sampingnya yang setelah kuperhatikan memiliki mata semerah buah Nephellium.

“Kenapa memangnya?” Kali ini temannya, si mata merah bertanya.

“Empat tahun lalu kita selalu kesini tiap hari, aku bosan…” keluh sosok hitam itu, yang sepertinya memiliki mata hijau seperti daun tua Nephellium.

Tunggu, Apa yang mereka lakukan empat tahun lalu?

“Mau bagaimana lagi, itu sudah tugas kita”

“Tapi kali ini siapa targetnya?” Si mata hijau kembali bertanya. Target apa? Apa yang akan mereka lalukan?

“Bos tidak bilang siapa, tapi yang jelas seseorang dari rumah ini” ucap si mata merah sembari menatap rumah kuning di balik pagar tua itu.

“Lantas siapa?”

“Bagaimana kalau si anak sulung?”

“Kamu yakin?”

“Tidak…sepertinya dia sulit” kuperhatikan si merah menggeleng, kemudian terdiam. Seperti sedang memikirkan sesuatu.

“Lalu? Si anak bungsu saja?” Usul si mata hijau.

“Dia pasti belum pulang jam sebegini”

“Jadi si wanita itu saja?”

“Hei, apa kau lupa tiga tahun lalu kita awalnya menargetkan wanita itu tapi gagal?”

Kulihat si mata hijau tertawa, seperti menertawakan usulannya sendiri “Oh iya ya, lalu siapa?

“Bagaimana kalau kita masuk saja dulu?”

“Lewat mana? Kita tidak bisa lewat depan, si sulung sepertinya sedang mengaji” Samar – samar aku mendengar suara perempuan yang melantunkan bacaan yang tidak kumengerti artinya.

“Kita lewat belakang kalau begitu”

“Belakang mana?” Lagi-lagi Si mata hijau kembali bertanya.

“Ikut saja lah” Karena penasaran aku memutuskan untuk mengikuti kedua sosok hitam itu yang mulai bergerak ke arah belakang rumah kuning itu

“Kamu yakin? Kita tidak muat” tanya sosok hitam bermata hijau itu sembari menatap lubang yang tidak lebih besar dari batang Nephellium.

“Kamu lupa kalau kita bisa berubah jadi apapun kan?” Sosok hitam bermata hijau itu refleks mengangguk ketika mendengar ucapan teman disampingnya

“Aku tidak lupa”

“Kalau begitu ayo” Kemudian tidak lama kulihat si mata merah mulai berubah bentuk. Astaga ternyata mereka benar-benar bisa menjadi apapun!

“Hei, bisakah kamu tidak berubah menjadi bentuk seperti itu? Menjijikkan. Kasihan jika si sulung atau wanita itu yang melihatmu, bisa shock nanti” Si mata hijau sontak menggerutu ketika melihat perubahan si mata merah.

“Aku tidak peduli, yang penting tugasku selesai malam ini” ucap si mata merah sembari menggeliat melewati saluran pembuangan.",Mistis
33,My Haunted House,4/16/2023,Chanderson,https://medium.com/@ch29anderson1008/my-haunted-house-439d9c35499d,"This is a story, about my home. I have lived in this house for a long time but only learned the strange and strange truth of my house. My house is quite spacious, when viewed from the front, like there are 2 houses made together. Because when I first bought a house, it was intentional that only half of it was renovated, and half of it was still an old building, in front of my house there was a yard and 2 mango trees at the right and left ends, and there was a little land behind the house. A few years went by and there was no strangeness at all, or maybe it was because I was a kid so I didn’t feel???? And it seems that what I know is just the beginning of other things that have existed since even before this house ever stood. At first I knew this truth because my house was being demolished/renovated. And I thought there was nothing wrong with my house, but I was wrong. On the first day the handyman came to check the house, everything went well and there were no problems whatsoever. After a few days have passed, the time has come when the floor of the house will be given rubble or raised the floor, and several other repairs. After a few days of demolishing the house, it was discovered that there was only 1 pole supporting my house. If you look like 1 pole that supports 2 houses and the location of the pole is in the middle of the border between new and old buildings. And our family thought positively that the wall used was so strong that it didn’t need a retaining iron, but I still couldn’t figure out how the house could still stand after the rain, wind, and earthquake. Indeed, an earthquake had occurred some time ago, but the strength was not so great. The next strangeness was revealed when the handyman was dismantling and cleaning the back of the house, so in one bedroom in my house had air conditioning, and the air conditioner was very hot even though it was often washed. And at the back of the house is a place where there is an outdoor AC component. And when checked, how surprising it is that there is a banyan tree growing behind the house, and its roots are wrapped around the outdoor air conditioning components. That’s why the air conditioner can’t run well and can’t cool down properly. And strangely the tree grows ON WALLS. The whole house is confused how there can be a banyan tree behind the house where the land is small and has been buried in used goods, but it can still grow, and strangely grows on the wall. Is it possible that the inside of the wall has soil so that the tree can grow??? I don’t know, at first I didn’t really care about it. And for the business of building one of the mango trees in front of my house must be cut down, at the time of fruiting. Nothing happened at first. But one day suddenly there was someone in my family who behaved strangely, we symbolized her as Rin. Rin always refuses when the back of the house has to be dismantled and renovated, and her attitude has been strange since the banyan and mango trees were cut down. It didn’t stop there, when we were going to the house of one of our relatives. Suddenly Rin was like a possessed person, because at that time we were talking about the house. Then Rin moved and acted like crazy, the look in her eyes was different from usual and the muscles on her body were pulled tight. Fortunately, the incident did not last long. The essence of the incident was that something in Rin (possessing Rin) did not accept that the 2 trees were cut down (banyan and mango), and she also did not accept that the back of the house would be demolished. That was the first time I saw someone actually acting unusual and I was scared. With the help of our prayers and trust, Rin finally returned to normal, until now Rin is still acting normal and I don’t know where something that possessed Rin went. Even as I write this, anxiety and fear still haunt me about the incident. I hope it’s okay in the future.",Mistis
34,Should've Left the Door Closed,4/3/2023,Lutfira N. Annisa,https://medium.com/@lutfiranura/shouldve-left-the-door-closed-19afa1644da3,"When I was 8, my little sister Allie was born. My baby sister was the center of my whole world. She babbled and smiled and laughed at every little thing that I did. One of my daily tasks was to read her bedtime stories with either Mom or Dad so I could also practice my reading. I loved her. Until one day, she disappeared.
I was exhausted from a whole day of showing Allie how to jump in a pile of dried leaves at the park. She was going to turn 1 soon and was able to walk a couple steps while holding my hand so maybe next fall she’d jump in with me. That night, I fell asleep after reading her Grimm Brother’s Little Red Riding Hood — grim, yes, but I was at that age. So when I woke up and heard quiet movements from Allie’s room, I feared for the worst. Is it The Wolf?’
I peeked through the keyhole on the door. It was hunched over Allie’s crib. Long, lanky limbs pushing its body high up, up, up the ceiling. It was so still, unmoving. I wanted to be brave — save Allie, stop the quiet fights my parents did when they thought I couldn’t hear, like at the park that day. I pushed the door open. It looked at me, its body turning but everything else was still. So still…
I was woken up by Mom’s shrill scream in the morning, like something was ripped away from her guts while she was awake. The following days were filled with interviews with the policemen, meeting child psychologists, retelling what I remembered happening that night over, and over, and over again. All to no avail. What were they supposed to do when I kept describing The Wolf? My parents no longer had meals together. The house was quiet. Eventually, I was sent to live with my Grandma, never accepted back at the home.
And now. Mom has been battling cancer the past couple of years, and it finally ended. I was told to come home to help with the ceremony. After the burial, I went to the house. It was the first time I have stepped foot in it after being sent away all those years ago. The west wing of the second floor — my and Allie’s bedrooms, were dimly lit. The massive maple tree in the front yard made it look even darker. Curious, I opened the door to Allie’s room. His crib was still at the exact same spot, dots of light from the street lights filled the room. I remember. I grappled for my phone, trying to dial 911. Trying. But then I heard It.
He whispered right behind my ear, “Sshh… Should’ve left the door closed.”
Everything went dark for a while — a minute, an hour, a day? I don’t know. I can hear the flutter of leaves, leaves crunching under footsteps, and my hands, straight yet limp above my head… feel wet.
I’m tired. I’m going back to sleep.

35,My Baby Son And The Open Closet Doors,5/19/2023,Trascending Tales,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28102,"In the dead of night, I retreated into my quarters after securing the doors. As I was updating one of my ongoing stories on my Kindle, I left my wife to tend to our baby boy, who is not even three months old; he will be three months old on May 22, 2023. My wife put my son down and went to the restroom around 12:43 a.m., so the baby was alone in his crib for 7 minutes or so. I saw her when she went to the restroom, so I knew Jasper was alone. At 12:50 am, I had a distinct feeling of unease jolting through me, causing me to return to the room.

To my dismay, the closet doors were wide open, which was concerning since my wife had seen me with her own eyes vividly close them, and I also remember closing them. I do this because of our baby's fascination with them; he stares way too much towards the closet. He also tends to always be staring all around the roof from side to side, which is not normal. Recently he started pointing, and it seems to me like he is pointing. He is not even 3 months old, but he is a very active and aware boy.

I was so puzzled by the closet door mystery that I immediately questioned my teenagers' movements, both of whom denied ever entering my room. And my daughter was passed out in her quarters. This left me perplexed - who opened the closet doors?

Furthermore, my baby's antics were mind-boggling, with him giggling and staring unblinkingly at the ceiling and the darkest corners of the room. Something in my home wasn't right. My son's preoccupation with the closet was especially apparent, considering babies aren't typically fascinated by those spaces. Every time I looked up from my writing, my son was staring at the top of the closet, making me more and more anxious by the minute. I'm worried about my son's welfare, but I can't decide if this was an innocent coincidence or otherwise. In an attempt to rule out the paranormal, I set up two cameras in the room to monitor my son's activities. As parents, we must never leave anything to chance where our children's safety is concerned.

Even though we've been monitoring the situation, our surveillance system has not captured any evidence of the strange phenomena. This led us to explore alternative solutions, such as using a ghost tube app.

Continuing on with the updates regarding the strange and unexplainable events unfolding in our home, I feel it is necessary to add a bit more context that might shed some light on the situation. As a long-time believer in spiritual entities, I have witnessed many unusual occurrences over the years and felt that it was only fitting to explore and understand these events better by using a ghost tube app. In the initial stages of using this app, we didn't see or capture anything out of the ordinary, but that quickly changed with recent sessions. Strangely, whenever I asked questions through the app, the stick figures would move to signify their response, and more often than not, they would say something directed at me specifically. The words ""Kop, Bill, fear me"" that the app delivered were wholly jarring, and it still amazes me that these entities could potentially harm my family and me. It's clear that there's more to this situation than meets the eye, and I can't help but feel that we're walking a fine line between safety and endangerment.

While I was holding Jasper during the communication, the app mentioned the words ""kiss, care, above, bike, mesas, bastante, esperar, genero, and viejo."" Although I couldn't decipher their significance, it was clear that they were unrelated and out of context. At the same time, Jasper began coughing and felt anxious, leading me to take him outside for his well-being. Throughout my session, I've also received other messages with different words like ""levitation, follow, help, lemon, Michael, if, night, quitter, insomnia,"" among others. However, I'm still struggling to understand their meaning and importance in this situation.

During the same sessions, I heard the app say, ""Alexander above,"" in a tone that insinuated a conjunction. While I was aware that it didn't make sense on the surface, I felt in my gut that it had some significance. Similarly, the phrase ""fear me"" repeatedly delivered by the app was a clear indication that the spirits or entities in question had malevolent intentions. Despite the fact that my name Alexander and my son's name Jasper were both uttered in my last session, the app directed the words ""You stopped after I completed an ""OUR FATHER PRAYER"""" in my room. I have come to notice that the stick figures direct their attention towards me and Jasper; it's a very eerie and unsettling feeling to be aware of this. One thing is clear: They're attempting to cause harm. I hope that I am wrong and that all they want to do is communicate something. Jasper's behavior became erratic and wearisome after they said his name out loud, and he got a cough right after. So I told my son, ""Let's go outside,"" and the spirit box app responded with ""do not."" It was clearly telling me not to take my son out of the room. But still worried and unsure of the situation and our safety, I decided to keep my son Jasper very close to me; if I don't have him, my wife does, or one of our children. Can't leave him alone. These messages were eerie and unsettling, making it clear that we must be cautious and pay attention to any clues concerning our safety.

In conclusion, we remain committed to the safety of our family and will continue to monitor the situation closely. We've explored whatever methods we feel are safe and available to us. I believe that there's more to uncover about what's happening in our home, and if needed, we'll seek professional help and guidance to resolve this long-standing issue. Thanks for your understanding and support. All of these events have taken a great emotional toll on me and Jasper, and it's challenging to cope with this situation while ensuring his safety. I'll continue to monitor the situation, and if needed, I'll seek the required help. Until then, I promise to keep you updated on any new developments. Thank you for reading.",Mistis
36,The Friendly One,4/8/2023,Ravenn,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28084,"I have always encountered things that are out of this world. From black silhouettes lurking in the dark to clear apparitions and sleep paralysis,I've encountered a lot of things. I always try to find logical explanations before believing that what I encounter is paranormal, but there are some things that happened and that I cannot explain. However, today I chose to tell you about the friendly ghost we have in our house.
I got married a few years ago and moved in with my husband. The house we are currently living in belonged to his grandmother. She lived and died here and he really, really loved her, they were very close.
The place has a cozy aura to it and, sometimes, I had the feeling that I was being watched. But it was not that frightening kind of feeling. It was like I knew someone was looking at me, but that did not scare me.
Some things happened.
For example, while I was home alone at night, I was in the living room watching TV and my cat jumped over some flower pots. One of the pots was falling, I could clearly see that, but I waited for it to fall, because I knew I couldn't get to it in time. However, right before completely falling over, the pot suddenly got back to its place, just as if someone had caught it and put it right back. I tried to think logically, but there wasn't any physically possible way in which the pot could have turned back on its own.
There were a few other things like things falling over at night, misplaced things that appeared days later. For example, I had this glass that I simply lost. My husband would often drink beer out of it and it just went missing. I asked him if he, by any chance, had broken it, but he told me that he didn't know anything about it. I looked for it everywhere, even believing at one point that maybe I've broken it and somehow forgot about it. Then, one night, my husband was sitting in the kitchen, sipping a beer and there weren't any other glasses on the table. At one point, something falls and glass shatters and when we look, it was that glass that we've been looking for, lying shattered on the floor. There wasn't any possible way for it to be there. It looked like it had fallen off the table, but it wasn't on the table to begin with. My husband really laughed and joked that that's his grandmother's way to make him stop drinking.

Another time, I was doing something at the window, and then when I turned around to leave, the curtain got stuck on something. I didn't bother to arrange it, I just turned towards the door. Just as I was reaching the door, I heard the curtain being pulled and when I looked, it was slowly being pulled to its place. I just smiled. I don't know why, but it felt like it was mocking me, like stop being lazy, putting the curtain in its place wasn't that hard, was it? I stopped thinking about it until the exact same thing happened, but in another room.
Sometimes, some little things that are misplaced by us just fall down. Like, I would put a perfume bottle on a shelf, its place isn't usually there, it would fall down.

After I gave birth to our daughter, there were times when I would be alone with her at night, trying to put her to sleep and I would feel a hand rest on my back or shoulder. At first I freaked out and yelled for my husband, but I got used to it in time. The same kind of touches woke me up in the middle of the night. I don't know how to explain it, it's just as someone puts his hand on me in a reassuring way.
In time, we got used to it. We don't freak out when we see something falling or when we hear something. This has been going on for about three years now, so I really think that it would have escalated until now if it was something malevolent. We like to think it's his grandma still caring about her place, prompting us to keep it organized.",Mistis
37,Reflections as a Senior: My Favorite Moments,4/12/2023,Mayoma Jolayemi '23,https://college.harvard.edu/student-life/student-stories/reflections-senior-my-favorite-moments,"The other day, I was sitting in my “Education in the Economy” seminar, listening to a discussion on the history of segregation in education and how that limits mobility for low-income students.
Full disclosure - I had been working late on my thesis the previous night and I was a bit tired. My professor sensed I needed a pick-me-up and came back into the classroom with a cup of Dove chocolates, exactly what I needed. As I unfurled the wrapper, I stopped for a second to read the quote they had left in this particular chocolate: “every moment matters, including this one.”  
Since then, I have been thinking of the many moments that make Harvard, Harvard. The happy moments, the sad moments, even the sleepy moments - they all matter. Here are a few of the small moments that I will miss the most.  
1) Just making it on a shuttle.  
I’m a quadling, that is, a student that lives in one of Harvard’s three Quad houses. The Quad neighborhood is located a 20-minute walk from the Yard, the center of campus. As a result, us quadlings frequently use the school’s shuttle system. While a 20-minute walk isn’t much, on a particularly cold day, missing the shuttle can hurt. And there’s nothing quite like the adrenaline and exhilaration that hits when you thought you were going to miss the shuttle and walk in the snow but make it just in time. I’ll miss that.  
2) Running into someone I haven’t seen in a while and then catching up in the middle of the Yard. 
Every so often, I’ll take a different route to my class, or I’ll have a new event on my schedule, and I’ll run into someone I don’t often see in the Yard. These unexpected encounters are the best.  
 
3) Swiping my ID into the dining hall before a meal.
I don’t know when, if ever, I’ll have to swipe an ID before eating - that’s one of those experiences that is pretty unique to college, and that I’ll think of wistfully. I love swiping into the dining hall because I get to say “hi” to Patricia at the front and greet all the other dining hall staff. Plus, it’s a little adventure getting to see what I get to eat that day! 
4) Laughing in my floor’s kitchen with my blockmates. 
This one goes without saying. While I know we’ll have plenty more kitchen laughs, I’m definitely going to miss living right next door to my closest friends. 
5) Rolling up my blinds in the morning and seeing the view of the towers in Cabot House and Pforzheimer House.  
Each day, I say “good morning” to my plants, Phil (who is a birkin philadendron) and Bambi (who is a bamboo), and roll up the blinds for them to get some sun. It’s an incredible view throughout the year; during the winter, snow tops the roofs of the other houses, and during the spring, you can see the light spill across the terrace. At night, the towers in Pfoho House and Cabot House light up, and I like to stare at them while I think and do work.  
 
6) Random dancing episodes in my friend’s room. 
Inspired by iCarly’s “random dancing” scenes, my friends and I will often hold random dance breaks to destress.  

7) Sunday walks to Church with my friends. 
8) Bluebiking along the Charles. 
On a warm day, I like to grab a Bluebike (one of the rentable bike options) from the docking station near my dorm and ride it down the Charles River. It’s so relaxing.  
 9) The first snow of the semester. 
10 ) The first warm day of the semester. 
11) Being stuck while working on a problem set and feeling frustrated. 
12) Finally understanding that question! 
13) The beep announcing that my Veritaffle is done cooking. 
On Sundays, we have brunch in the dining hall with a couple of waffle makers that create a waffle with the Harvard crest. You put the batter in the waffle makers, and two minutes later you hear a beep alerting you that you’re in for a delicious treat. 
14) Sitting on the quad lawn and taking in the sun. 
15) Eating my morning apple on the walk to class. 
16) Hanging out Procrastinating with friends when we all have a ton of work to do. 
17) Closing all the tabs on my computer after finals or midterms.
There’s nothing quite like the peace right after a major season of exams. While I was writing my thesis, I had 4 different windows open dedicated to my research, and each window had about 20 - 40 tabs open with academic papers I wanted to cite, background knowledge on the topic, and citation tools. The day I submitted my thesis, I went through and individually closed each additional tab, which was the most relaxing thing. I’ll miss getting to do that.  
18) Walking out of a class in Sever Hall.  
When you leave Sever, you enter Tercentenary  Theatre, the portion of the Yard that includes Widener Library and Memorial Church. They are incredible architectural structures, and I love getting to admire them each time I leave a class or meeting in that building. This is also where Commencement will be held in a few short weeks, and I’m reminded of that each time I find myself in Tercentenary Theatre. 
Although I’ll miss each of these moments, I am so grateful to have experienced them (and to be still experiencing them!). I encourage everyone to reflect on the small moments in their lives that we tend to overlook but still matter. These are the little things that have made me feel at home in my four years here, and I’m excited to see what moments the next chapter will bring.  ",Pengalaman Pribadi
38,The Transformative Power of a Bachelor’s Degree,5/15/2023,Clive Walker,https://medium.com/the-university-avenue/the-transformative-power-of-a-bachelors-degree-9b9b056c373e,"In an increasingly interconnected and fiercely competitive global economy characterized by relentless technological innovation, earning a bachelor’s degree has become a vital launchpad toward an enriching future. The multifaceted influence of a bachelor’s degree stretches beyond the mere acquisition of specialized knowledge and technical skills, serving as a powerful catalyst for amplifying your future prospects in a variety of compelling ways. This transformative potential is especially prominent in the 21st-century landscape, where the appetite for a highly educated and adept workforce is on a steep rise across a myriad of industries. Let’s delve deeper into the many ways a bachelor’s degree can turbocharge your journey in life, professionally and personally.
Earning a bachelor’s degree has been likened to acquiring a master’s key, capable of unlocking a plethora of career opportunities in a diverse range of fields. A multitude of today’s professions lay down a bachelor’s degree as the baseline for entry-level positions. Even in scenarios where a degree isn’t an explicit requirement, candidates armed with a bachelor’s degree often enjoy a competitive edge, turning the heads of potential employers. Let’s take the case of an aspiring journalist with a bachelor’s degree in journalism or communications. This individual stands a significantly better chance of landing a prized position at a reputed news outlet compared to those without such qualifications. Similarly, in sectors such as advertising or public relations, a bachelor’s degree can be the distinguishing factor that sets a candidate apart from the competition.
In considering the rapidly expanding tech industry, jobs in software development, data analysis, and cyber-security often require a bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field as a prerequisite, even in sectors like hospitality or retail, where a degree might not be an absolute necessity, having a bachelor’s in business administration or a similar field can exponentially enhance your prospects of clinching managerial roles, thereby setting the stage for a bright career trajectory. Individuals with a bachelor’s degree under their belt typically enjoy higher earnings compared to those whose highest education level is a high school degree. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data reveals an eye-opening 67% difference in median weekly earnings between bachelor’s degree holders and high school graduates. When viewed over the span of an individual’s working life, this wage gap can balloon into a substantial sum, greatly enhancing one’s financial stability and quality of life.
Another noteworthy advantage conferred by holding a bachelor’s degree is the lower unemployment rate. This not only imparts a sense of job security but also signifies that degree holders may find it easier to secure employment, even in the face of economic downturns. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, the unemployment rate among bachelor’s degree holders remained significantly lower than for those with just a high school education. This underscores the resilience offered by a degree during challenging times. Earning a bachelor’s degree also ushers in a host of intangible benefits. It cultivates indispensable skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication, all of which are highly sought after in the modern workplace. Take the case of a philosophy major, for example. A degree in philosophy may not point directly to a specific career path, but it hones critical thinking and logical reasoning skills to a fine point. These highly transferable skills are in high demand across a variety of sectors, from law to business consulting, thereby broadening the career horizons for philosophy graduates.
The bachelor’s degree journey often also sets the stage for profound personal growth and development. College life exposes students to a vibrant mosaic of perspectives, fostering cultural sensitivity and empathy. It also cultivates self-discipline, time management, and independent thinking — skills that prove invaluable in both personal and professional contexts. These skills can translate to improved interpersonal relationships, a balanced work-life equation, and heightened self-awareness. For instance, skillfully managing group projects can lead to refined teamwork and leadership capabilities, assets that are beneficial in both personal life and the corporate world.
A bachelor’s degree can also serve as a stepping stone towards further educational pursuits, such as master’s or doctoral degrees. These advanced educational levels open the door to specialized and often higher-paying careers in academia, research, or industry. A bachelor’s degree in psychology, for instance, may lead to a master’s or doctorate, opening up the path to becoming a licensed psychologist. In a similar vein, a bachelor’s degree in biology can provide the springboard for a rewarding career in medical research or pharmaceuticals with further study.
In essence, a bachelor’s degree equips individuals with an impressive array of knowledge, skills, and experiences, all of which can dramatically enhance future prospects. It does so by paving the way for a multitude of diverse and fulfilling career paths, significantly boosting earning potential and fostering personal growth and development. Furthermore, it lays the groundwork for the pursuit of advanced education. In a world that’s increasingly competitive and rapidly evolving, a bachelor’s degree undeniably acts as a potent instrument for individuals to sculpt a promising future, both in terms of their professional trajectory and their personal journey.

39,My college experience,5/7/2023,Laurent Etienne,https://medium.com/@1804madej/-a02ddb127535,"I faced challenges and obstacles that I had never heard about in those past college experience conversations. Suddenly there was no one to get me out of a jam — I had to figure it all out on my own. The summer after my senior year, I used to try and imagine what my first semester was going to be like based on what I had heard people talk about in the past. After (almost) my first semester , I realized that I could not fully understand what college was like until I experienced it for myself. My first couple of weeks in college was rough and really tested my strength (mental and physical).

I missed a lot of classes in college because I stayed out late the night before. In high school, the teacher would constantly remind us of when certain assignments were due, but this was not the case in college. I learned this the hard way my first semester. Sometimes I forgot to turn in an assignment because I did not properly read my syllabus, or my professor never mentioned it. These were all unfamiliar problems that could have easily gotten worse without taking the proper action. I was doing well, but a few of my grades began to plummet. I was losing confidence in myself and started to wonder if going to college was the best decision. The time had come for me to grow up and become an adult, even though I did not feel like I was ready. I began attending tutoring sessions, working with my peers, and keeping a daily to-do list. These factors eventually led to drastic improvement and success. After my first couple months, I learned how to better manage my time, take advantage of campus resources, and organize myself better. These struggles also taught me that sometimes I try and rush through things instead of taking my time.

I believe that you should not be part of a crowd that is only at school to party and have fun; instead, I believe that you should join a group that will help you with your education while also allowing you to have fun. You should also have good relationships with your professors so that you can go to them and talk about any problems or issues you are having with the classes you are taking. They may be able to give you advice on how to improve in the class that you are struggling in, or they may simply be someone to talk to. Professors are excellent resources for you to begin doing your best.

I was dealt a difficult hand in my youth, leaving little time for self-discovery. School or success, according to others in my life, were not in my future. I got to college, and I am completely lost. My major is biology, but it is not my passion. I have been considering public health, computer science, computer engineering, and other options. I am still undecided, but I know bio is not for me. This first semester I had intro to university, and it was led by a well-rounded mentor Guerby, an understanding professor and a class that whenever you stepped inside a slight amount of anxiety and relief hits due to you getting thought stuff you did not know about college and the realization that: ‘’Wow, I am in college.’’

I am unsure whether to major in nursing or engineering at first or what my passions are outside of athletics. I am still taking prerequisites because the engineering curriculum has not started yet. By the end of this first semester, I knew I wanted to change majors. I saw that there would be a pH class in the spring semester, and I would like to sit in and see if it is of taste. I hope I can handle it based on my previous communication skills, hobbyist experience, and past work experiences. I hope I do well.

In conclusion, my college experience has been unique thus far. College Life introduced me to new experiences that I had always hoped to have after finishing high school. Many people, including myself, are fortunate to be able to enjoy our college years because some of our peers and their circumstances or financial difficulties do not allow such an opportunity. College Life means something different to everyone.to me it is a beautiful experience. While some people spend their college years partying with their friends, others become more serious about their careers and work hard in the classroom. I work to be both and balance my time well this semester and the next. With both choices lead to the path to self-discovery, new ways of thinking and growth they are part of the beauty of college in my perspective.",Pengalaman Pribadi
40,Pengalaman Memulai Jualan Pisang,1/16/2021,"Masim ""Vavai"" Sugianto",https://medium.com/@vavai/pengalaman-memulai-jualan-pisang-c4cf1af667c8,"Ini adalah cerita, share pengalaman. Bukan tips bukan saran, karena bisa saja beda situasi jika diterapkan ditempat lain. Saat masih kecil, saya pernah berjualan es mambo, kue-kue buatan enyak (ibu) saya dan juga pernah berjualan petasan 🙂 . Jadi meski pekerjaan saya belakangan lebih banyak terkait IT, saya tetap ada latar belakang pengalaman berjualan. Tapi isteri saya tidak memiliki latar belakang berjualan. Jadi saat saya sampaikan rencana berjualan pisang dengan membuka kios pisang, isteri saya heboh karena timbul banyak pertanyaan. Apa laku? Gimana kalau nggak laku? Gimana kalau pisangnya nggak laku dan jadi ada yang busuk? Gimana kalau ada yang komplain? Gimana menentukan harga jual? Gimana kalau rugi? Pengalaman 1 : Exit Strategy
Oke, satu per satu ya. Pertanyaan pertama, “Apa laku?”
Ya harus dicoba lha ya. Kalau nggak dicoba, bagaimana bisa tahu akan laku atau tidak? Bagaimana memastikan agar bisa laku? Pilih pisang yang bagus, yang cakep dan yang menarik minat.

Gimana kalau nggak laku? Itu sebabnya kalau berencana jualan harus berpikir komprehensif. Kan berpikir saja mah nggak perlu bayar. Kita cuma memikirkan gimana kalau ada yang nggak laku, rugi dong? Iyalah. Terus bagaimana kalau terus rugi, bisa bangkrut dong? Iyalah. Terus kalau iyalah, gimana bisa usaha lagi.

Harus dipikirkan exit strategi-nya. Jalan keluarnya. Kalau pisang tampilannya kurang menarik, dia harus dipindah dari display utama. Harus ditentukan mau diapakan. Kalau pisang olahan seperti pisang nangka, itu bisa dijadikan kue pisang. Pisang uli atau kepok, dijadikan pisang goreng. Pisang ambon atau tanduk bisa dijadikan sebagai sale pisang.

Kalau pisangnya masih bagus hanya lepas dari sisir (patah), saya kirimkan ke team saya yang bekerja di lokasi lain. Pilihan lain adalah dikirimkan ke yayasan yang dikelola. Untuk cemilan anak-anak. Karena masalahnya hanya di tampilan saja.

Kalau sudah tidak bisa diselamatkan sama sekali atau sudah terlambat untuk diselamatkan, ya berarti dikirim jadi makanan ternak.

Hal-hal diatas akan mendidik kita mengenai manajemen ketersediaan stock. Berdasarkan data frekuensi penjualan setiap hari yang pada interval waktu tertentu dibuatkan ringkasannya (kesimpulan), akan terlihat pisang mana yang sebaiknya diperbanyak stocknya dan pisang mana yang cukup beberapa sisir saja ketersediaannya. Data tersebut juga akan membantu kita dalam mengatur perkiraan jumlah pisang matang dan pisang mentah.

Saat awal berencana berjualan pisang, saya tahu salah satu kendala utama adalah mengatasi masalah stock. Jika stock terlalu banyak sedangkan hasil penjualan sedikit, akan banyak pisang yang tidak menghasilkan pendapatan yang memadai. Benar bisa diolah kembali, namun nilai ekonominya jauh lebih rendah. Kalau stock dibuat sedikit saja, pembeli bisa jadi ragu untuk datang, karena hanya sedikit. Kita sebagai pembeli kelapa muda misalnya, tentu memilih penjual kelapa muda yang punya stock banyak dibandingkan yang sedikit, karena di penjual kelapa muda dengan stock banyak, kita bisa memilih mana yang sesuai dengan yang kita inginkan.

Masalahnya, kita tidak akan pernah tahu kisaran stock yang paling tepat jika tidak pernah mencobanya.

Saya memprediksi, 2 minggu hingga 1 bulan pertama adalah tahap pengenalan. Jadi by design harus ada persiapan budget untuk berdarah-darah di periode tersebut. Istilah di startup IT semacam bakar uang. Seperti Gojek dan Grab yang awal-awal banyak memberikan promo. Fokusnya adalah mengenalkan layanan dan membesarkan pangsa pasar. Bedanya, investor mereka punya power budget yang besar, berbeda dengan kita-kita yang punya power terbatas. Jadi budget yang disiapkan juga harus diperkirakan dan dikelola sebaik-baiknya.

Maksud sebaik-baiknya, budget diutamakan untuk hal-hal yang sifatnya mandatory atau wajib. Contohnya, untuk membeli pisang dengan kualitas yang bagus. Harganya bisa lebih mahal daripada pisang yang diserok seadanya. Pisang dengan harga 10 ribu per kg misalnya, sebenarnya oke saja kalau kita bisa jual diatas itu. Tapi pisang dengan harga seribu rupiah per kg tetap terasa mahal jika tidak bisa terjual dan menjadi sampah. Jadi harus dibedakan mana yang sifatnya pemborosan dan mana yang memang harus dilakukan.

Saya memang mengeluarkan budget untuk kebersihan tempat dan display, karena target pasar yang dikejar membutuhkan hal tersebut. Bisa saja saya menyewa tempat dengan budget lebih rendah dengan tampilan sederhana jika memang lingkungan target pembelinya membutuhkan hal tersebut.

Contoh pengelolaan budget misalnya, saya memakai meja bekas yang saya pakai di Excellent (kantor tempat saya bekerja sebagai team IT). Pisau untuk memotong saya ambil dari stock pisau di rumah. Untuk memotong tandan buah, saya gunakan gergaji kecil yang cukup bagus dan ergonomis dengan harga tidak sampai 50 ribu rupiah. Saat waktunya makan siang, saya pulang ke rumah untuk makan siang di rumah, jadi bisa berhemat.
Saat awal merintis usaha ya harus mau berkorban. Sacrifice. Kalau awal usaha pendapatan baru 50 ribu rupiah tapi makan habis 70 ribu rupiah berarti nombok. Meskipun punya budget, lama-lama akan habis juga. Jadi harus realistis dan mau menekan ego.

Pengalaman 2 : Menentukan Harga Jual
Bagaimana caranya menentukan harga jual? Karena baru pertama kali jualan pisang, ya tentu saya bingung. Keluarga juga bingung.

Kekhawatirannya pasti sama di semua orang yang baru mau usaha. Diberikan harga A, khawatir kemahalan, tidak ada yang beli. Diberikan harga B, khawatir terlalu murah dan tidak menutup biaya. Berarti harus dicari tahu harga yang tepat.

Ya itu masalahnya. Harga tepatnya berapa? Jangan ngomong tinggi padahal kosong. Contohnya ngomong, “Key of Success adalah Kunci Kesuksesan”. Kelihatannya elite ngomong pakai bahasa Linggis 🙂 padahal nggak ada maknanya.

Percaya ya, nggak ada harga yang tepat. Nggak ada yang tahu. Kalau tidak pernah coba dilakukan.

Berarti kita harus cari tahu. Berarti mesti survei. Ini yang biasa dilakukan perusahaan, tapi kita lakukan dengan cara sederhana namun tetap kita bungkus dengan bahasa keren : riset pasar, hehehe…

Saya sering membeli pisang, karena saya memang penggemar pisang. Tapi yang saya beli hanya pisang yang saya sukai. Pisang Ambon pernah. Pisang Tanduk pernah. Pisang Raja Bulu pernah. Pisang Barangan, Lampung dan pisang Ampyang juga pernah. Tapi ada lebih banyak jenis pisang yang tidak pernah saya beli atau saya lupa harga. Jadi tetap harus ada riset. Dalam bentuk apa? Dalam bentuk, membeli pisang dari pedagang eceran. Dari tukang sayur atau dari penjual lain dipinggir jalan.

Saya berikan uang 100 ribu rupiah pada salah satu rekan yang biasa membantu saya. Pesannya : “Beli pisang masing-masing 1 sisir, jenisnya boleh pisang apa saja tapi yang umum dijual atau dibeli”. Dari situ akan ketahuan harga pasaran pisang. Tidak tepat sama karena tergantung besar kecilnya pisang dan juga tergantung penjualnya. Kalau penjualnya pingin cepat kaya kan bisa saja jual dengan harga mahal dan bertemu dengan kita yang lugu ya klop, pisang terjual dengan harga maksimum, hehehe..

Harga boleh berbeda tergantung penjual, tapi kalau kita membeli 2 atau 3x dengan ukuran yang umum, akan bisa didapatkan perkiraan harga pasaran. Kita bisa bandingkan lagi dengan bertanya pada teman yang biasa membeli pisang agar prediksi harga pasaran bisa lebih mendekati harga umumnya.

Mengapa tidak tanya ke penjual saja. Tanya ke penjual sayur, “Bang, pisang Ambon berapa?”. Kalau dijawab, nanti tanya lagi pisang yang lain dan seterusnya. Yang ada, bukannya dapat harga, kita malah kena damprat, “Kamu mau beli pisang apa tanya-tanya seperti mau sensus” 😛

Ya nggak apa-apa keluar biaya untuk survei. Kan pisangnya juga bisa dimakan atau diolah. Jadi bukan biaya yang keluar percuma.

Setelah mendapatkan harga pasaran untuk penjualan, tugas selanjutnya adalah mencari pisang untuk dijual. Meski dari kebun sendiri, biaya HPP (Harga Pokok Penjualan) bukan nol ya. Jangan mentang-mentang hasil tanam sendiri di pekarangan, dianggap biayanya nol, jadi dijual 10 ribu 1 tandan juga masih untung. Iya masih untung tapi bisa merusak harga.

Saya survei ke pasar, ke pengepul pisang. Kali ini datang untuk membeli pisang per tandan atau per sisir untuk dijual kembali. Pisang yang dipilih adalah pisang yang belum diproduksi di kebun sendiri. Jadi pisang untuk melengkapi display dagangan berdasarkan frekuensi yang ditanyakan.

Jangan kaget ya, kadang penjual dengan level pengepul juga nggak kira-kira memberikan harga. 1 sisir pisang diminta 35 ribu sampai dengan 40 ribu per sisir. Saya beli pisang jenis tersebut di eceran saja harganya 15–30 ribu rupiah. Kalau dipengepul dijual dengan harga 35 ribu rupiah, lantas berapa harga penjualan di eceran?

Kita sama-sama tahu, semua juga ingin harga bagus. Petani ingin dapat harga bagus. Pengepul ingin dapat harga (dan margin bagus). Penjual eceran juga sama. Jadi memang harus keseimbangan.

Karena kita sudah tahu harga eceran, kita jadi punya dasar untuk menawar pada pengepul. Tidak dalam konteks menekan harga melainkan untuk memudahkan saat menjual eceran (karena saya juga petani dan tentu senang kalau harga jual di level petani bisa bagus). Kalau misalnya harga eceran 20 ribu rupiah, kita bisa ada kisaran margin jika mendapatkan pisang dengan harga dibawah itu, misalnya 15 ribu atau 17 ribu.

Bagaimana jika kita membeli pisang 1 tandan dan ukurannya beragam. Ada yang besar dan ada yang kecil. Bagaimana menentukan harga jual per sisir? Disini kita bisa dibantu timbangan. Saya membeli timbangan digital (sebenarnya untuk menimbang sale dan keripik pisang). Saya pilih salah satu pisang dengan perkiraan harga yang sudah diketahui. Misalnya 1 sisir pisang dengan ukuran yang sama yang pernah kita beli dihargai 15 ribu rupiah. Kita timbang beratnya. Nanti harga dibagi berat akan didapat harga per gram.

Contohnya, 1 pisang dengan perkiraan harga 15 ribu rupiah ternyata beratnya 1.5 kg. Berarti harga per gram 10 rupiah. Kalau ada pisang lain dengan berat 1 kg, perkiraan harganya 10 ribu rupiah. Pisang lain yang lebih kecil dengan berat 850 gram berarti harganya 8500 rupiah.

Bagaimana jika beratnya tidak bulat? Misalnya beratnya 935 gram. Apakah dijual dengan harga 9350 rupiah? Ya boleh saja. Tapi saya biasanya mengambil pembulatan kebawah. Misalnya jadi 9000 rupiah.

Setelah dapat harga dan dibandingkan dengan harga pokok sudah mendapat margin, saya membuat label harga. Saya membeli alat pembuat label harga merk Joyko. Mengapa diberi label? Karena repot jika harus mengingat harga masing-masing pisang, nanti kisaran harganya kacau.

Kalau sudah ada label harga, kita bisa dengan mudah mengecek harga. Kalaupun satu saat kita tidak ditempat dan kios ditunggui oleh orang lain atau oleh orang yang dipekerjakan, mereka bisa menjualnya dengan mudah karena harganya sudah ada.

Bagaimana kalau sudah ada label harga tapi tetap ditawar. Ya tidak apa-apa. Namanya konsumen kan boleh saja menawar. Kalau tawarannya nggak masuk ya disampaikan dengan sopan. Kalau bisa dipenuhi, kan bisa menyenangkan konsumen. Misalnya pisang dengan harga 15 ribu rupiah. Kondisinya sudah matang sempurna. Kalau lewat 1–2 hari kemungkinan tampilan tidak menarik. Daripada malah lepas hanya karena pembeli menawar lebih rendah seribu-dua ribu rupiah, bisa diiyakan meski marginnya jadi lebih kecil.

Kalau sudah beberapa kali, nanti keluwesan bisa didapat dengan sendirinya. Pernah salah tidak apa-apa kok, asal jangan keseringan. Kalau kita takut salah dan serba takut mengambil keputusan, sampai tahun dua juta juga kita nggak akan pernah mencoba sesuatu yang sebenarnya berpeluang dan menarik untuk dilakukan.

Panjang sekali cerpennya? Ini bukan cerpen, ini cerbung, cerita bersambung 🙂 . Karena saya biasa menulis blog, jadi harap maklum kalau tulisannya panjang. Lagian salahnya sendiri kenapa dibaca, hehehe… Ini juga pengalaman pribadi, jadi dishare disini dengan harapan kalau ada kesalahan, rekan yang lain bisa menghindarinya. Jika ada yang bagus, bisa dicoba ditempat masing-masing.",Pengalaman Pribadi
41,Things I regret when I was in college,4/7/2023,Ameer Muavia,https://medium.com/@ameermuaviaa116/things-i-regret-when-i-was-in-college-7e323868557a,"College is a time of growth, learning, and self-discovery. It’s a time to explore new opportunities, make mistakes, and learn from them. Looking back on my college years, there are several things that I regret. Here are some of the things I wish I had done differently during my time in college.

Not exploring more opportunities

One of my biggest regrets is not taking advantage of all the opportunities available to me in college. I wish I had explored more extracurricular activities, joined more clubs, and attended more events. I was so focused on my studies that I missed out on many opportunities to meet new people, learn new skills, and broaden my horizons.

Not asking for help

Another regret I have is not asking for help when I needed it. I was too proud to ask for help and thought I could handle everything on my own. This led to unnecessary stress and anxiety, and I missed out on valuable opportunities for growth and learning. I wish I had reached out to my professors, peers, and counselors for guidance and support.

Not taking care of my health

College can be a stressful and demanding time, and I regret not taking better care of my physical and mental health. I neglected my diet, exercise, and sleep, which impacted my academic performance and overall well-being. I wish I had made self-care a priority and sought out resources for mental health and wellness.

Not traveling more

One of the biggest regrets I have is not traveling more during college. I had the opportunity to study abroad and explore different parts of the world, but I chose to stay close to home. Looking back, I wish I had taken advantage of those opportunities to broaden my cultural horizons and gain new perspectives.

Not making more meaningful connections

Finally, I regret not making more meaningful connections during my college years. I had many acquaintances, but few close friendships that lasted beyond graduation. I wish I had invested more time and effort in building meaningful relationships with my peers, professors, and mentors.

In conclusion, college is a time of growth and learning, but it’s also a time of mistakes and regrets. Looking back on my college years, I wish I had explored more opportunities, asked for help when I needed it, taken better care of my health, traveled more, and made more meaningful connections. While I can’t change the past, I can use these lessons to guide my future and make the most of the opportunities that come my way.",Pengalaman Pribadi
42,How I Finally Figured Out What To Major In During College,3/5/2023,Nicole Kisslinger,https://medium.com/@nicolekisslinger/how-i-finally-figured-out-what-to-major-in-during-college-8c0e9a5241e,"A stressful, but very needed process. Reflecting back to my undergrad days feels like it was just yesterday… Well, in reality, it’s only been about 6 months since college graduation.

My college journey wasn’t anything absolutely crazy or wild. In fact, it was probably considered less than typical since I majored in multiple different pathways.

When I was in high school, I decided to go through a Bridge Program to go to college early. Now, let’s not get ahead of ourselves, it wasn’t the traditional route I wanted to take.

High school was a bit of a never-ending nightmare for me — something we’ll talk about later on down the line. The bridge program was a chance to leave high school early every day and take classes at our local community college campus, Dutchess Community College, while still in high school. So of course, I took the opportunity to receive college credits early AND get out of that school — a win-win in my eyes. 🏆However, this was the starting point of a series of twists and turns that would soon come shortly after this decision was made. What do I even major in?

During this time, I also applied to a series of colleges during my senior year like most traditional students. One thing is for certain though, I had NO idea what I was doing. I applied for the most random of majors all because I thought it was up my alley and something I would enjoy. We’re talking Communications at SUNY New Paltz, Marine Biology at the University of Tampa, Psychology at New England College, and Hospitality and Tourism at Niagara University. It was a hot mess one could say…

In my bridge program, I wasn’t technically allowed to pick a major since I was still technically in high school. I believe admissions marked my transcript as Associate of Arts (because I told them I enjoyed art). I had to take a few of the high school classes that were college-level courses, but then I was given the opportunity to also partake in electives at my community college. So, like any other art-loving teenager, I decided to enroll in some art classes. Hence, the initial transcript deemed I was going for an Associate of Arts (A.A).

Although, that didn’t last long. As soon as my senior year was over, I decided to immediately apply and enroll at my local private college, Marist College. I went in as an “Undeclared,” considering a majority of my art classes in my community college deterred me away from studying art when I realized I enjoyed it more recreationally.I actually had a class at Marist called LERN 104L that was a “Self Development” course to promote values, goal setting, motivation, assertiveness, self-esteem, and career direction. This was one of the most influential classes I’ve ever taken in my college journey and with one of the best professors I’ve had (who just so happened to be my advisor).

LEARN 104L helped me determine my personality skills, build up my character and lead me to at least part of a future direction. From here, I decided I wanted to major in Psychology. I went to my advisor, brought home the paperwork, and was about to sign them until I realized I still had a burning passion for art…

This is when the fun comes in. I threw out the papers and requested information on Marist’s Fashion Design college. I was interested in art and wanted to help people — I knew that much. Their program told me I needed a portfolio for the design aspect (something I did not have) and then told me I could apply for the Fashion Merchandising portion, but I’d still have to present my skills and write. So of course, I took that project on at the end of the fall semester (specifically November, due in December).

I ended up not hearing back from the program. I hated the atmosphere and wasn’t enjoying my classes, so I decided to drop out and re-enroll back at Dutchess Community College for the spring (shocker). However, they didn’t ask me what major I wanted, and instead, just put me for an Associate of Science (A.S.) in General Studies. I dropped out again within a week… Again, shocker, I know.

I worked and wrote a book during this period of time before going back to school. (We’ll talk about this later on.) During this time, I applied to a series of schools for “giggles” — again, to see what different majors I’d get into. Psychology at SUNY Albany is one of the few, just to name. Later that spring, I decided to enroll back in school (Dutchess to be specific), for the summer session, going back to studying General Studies. I didn’t necessarily want to study something so plain, however, I believe it was the fastest way for me to graduate with my peers even though I transferred and took a semester or ~two off.

Once I graduated with my Associate of Science (A.S.) in General Studies, I had to move on to a Bachelor’s. Where did I decide to go? That’s right, SUNY New Paltz… Well, technically at least.

I didn’t actually make it to SUNY New Paltz. I initially tried to apply for their Art Education program because I decided maybe I wanted to be an elementary school art teacher. They told me again, I needed a portfolio and I was super discouraged. Now when I would have time to create a whole portfolio?! I applied as a Women’s Gender and Sexuality Studies major and got in. Looking back, I have no idea what I was going to do with this degree in the long run…

I picked my classes and everything. Even a dorm I was going to be living in. But as all good stories go — I got cold feet about 3 weeks before move-in day and backed out of the entire school. I ended up going BACK to Marist College, but online this time, studying Professional Studies. (Which technically was a glorified version of multiple majors mixed into one; think of Organized Leadership, Psychology, Communications, Sociology, Public Management, Administration, Data Center Studies, and IT Tech Management all combined into one).

But don’t worry, I only lasted a semester here before I realized this was incredibly boring and I needed something more fulfilling. SHOCKER! (I know we’re all laughing at this rate).

I applied to Penn State World Campus for a Bachelor of Design (B.Des.) in Digital Multimedia Design, and a Certification (Cert.) in Digital Arts.

AND FINALLY — this was where I settled down and graduated. I then moved on to study and go for my Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S) in Strategic Communications. (Don’t fret, I’m still here now and graduating in August! We are chugging along and loving it!)

In conclusion, if you’re reading this and can relate to this mess of a college major-picking scandal, then I’m sorry for the brain cells you might also have lost in the process!

If you’re in high school freaking out over the future, don’t. I know it’s easier said than done (and heck, I’m still panicking too). However, just know you can always change the path you’re going down and you don’t have to stick with anything that makes you unhappy.

You’re allowed to have multiple likes and dislikes and enjoy different topics! This is what college is about! Exploring your passions and figuring out what you are dedicated to!",Pengalaman Pribadi
43,How College Students Can Use ChatGPT to 10x Productivity,1/26/2023,Tairique Davis,https://medium.com/@tdavis4616/how-college-students-can-use-chatgpt-to-10x-productivity-55d6bcaea977,"As a college student, the pressure to balance classes, studying, extracurricular activities, and a social life can be overwhelming.

With that said, why not give ChatGPT a try and see how it can help you improve your productivity today? Trust me, it’s a decision you will not regret. (Unless, of course, you don’t like being more productive, in which case, I don’t know what to tell you.)",Pengalaman Pribadi
44,Bertransaksi Online Menggunakan Kartu Kredit Indonesia Sangatlah Aman,9/7/2015,Natali Ardianto,https://medium.com/@nataliardianto/bertransaksi-online-menggunakan-kartu-kredit-indonesia-sangatlah-aman-4da74b99f0f5,"Kemarin saya melihat artikel mengenai aktivitas carder yang menggunakan kartu kredit terbitan Indonesia di salah satu situs e-commerce di Indonesia.

Dari artikel tersebut, saya diarahkan ke sebuah akun twitter. Di akun twitter tersebut, si empunya pemilik akun twitter tersebut curhat bahwa kartu kreditnya digunakan untuk fraud di situs e-commerce tersebut.

Dan lebih apesnya lagi, pemilik akun tersebut memiliki 36,9 ribu followers. Alhasil, banyak yang me-mention pemilik akun tersebut, mengeluhkan bahwa kartu kredit mereka juga digunakan oleh carder. Semua mention itu di retweet oleh pemilik akun sehingga bisa dibaca banyak orang, termasuk saya.

Ternyata, banyak sekali yang kartu kreditnya dibajak oleh carder dan dipakai untuk bertransaksi di situs e-commerce tersebut.

Lalu kenapa dibilang aman, Nat?
Kartu kredit yang diterbitkan oleh bank-bank di Indonesia sangat aman, karena Bank Indonesia mewajibkan banyak hal kepada para penerbit kartu kredit, yang tujuan utamanya adalah melindungi konsumen.

1. Semua kartu kredit terbitan bank di Indonesia harus mendukung 3D Secure
Semua penerbit kartu kredit di Indonesia diwajibkan untuk mengimplementasikan 3D Secure oleh Bank Indonesia. 3DS adalah singkatan dari 3 Domain Secure. Apa itu 3DS?

3DS atau 3 Domain Secure adalah perlindungan kartu kredit dimana yang bertanggung jawab adalah 3 pihak, yaitu Acquiring Bank (Bank yang mengambil uang), Issuing Bank (Bank yang menerbitkan kartu kredit) dan Payment Gateway & Merchant (Sistem yang memproses transaksi).

Perbedaan mencolok dari 3DS dibandingkan proses transaksi kartu kredit online konvensional adalah adanya satu tahapan extra, dimana setelah mengirimkan informasi kartu kredit, anda akan diminta untuk memasukkan OTP (One Time Pin) berupa nomer PIN acak yang dikirimkan ke nomer ponsel Anda.

Dengan flow seperti ini, hal ini menyelesaikan masalah Card Not Present (CNP), dimana ketika anda bertransaksi menggunakan kartu kredit secara fisik, Anda harus menyerahkan kartu kredit itu untuk digesek, sehingga peluang fraud menjadi sangat kecil karena kartu secara fisik harus ada.

3DS adalah teknik yang dikembangkan oleh Arcot Systems, Inc dan diimplementasikan oleh Visa (menggunakan nama Verified by Visa), MasterCard (MasterCard SecureCode), JCB (J/Secure) dan Amex (American Express SafeKey).

2. Customer dan Merchant Terlindungi
Keuntungan dari 3DS ini sangat banyak. Untuk customer, adanya 3DS menjaminan bahwa kartu kredit tidak akan dapat dibajak untuk transaksi fraud. Yang tadinya cukup memasukkan informasi kartu kredit yang semuanya tertera di kartu kredit, kini terdapat tambahan layer OTP, sehingga jika pun informasi kartunya bocor, carder tidak dapat bertransaksi karena tidak akan mendapatkan OTP yang hanya dikirimkan ke nomer ponsel pemilik kartu.

Untuk merchant, ada yang namanya Shifted Liability. Dengan adanya Shifted Liability, artinya untuk setiap transaksi fraud yang terjadi, yang bertanggung jawab untuk mengembalikan uang (chargeback) bukanlah merchant, namun bank issuer.

Dengan Shifted Liability ini, pihak merchant tidak perlu khawatir akan tingginya fraud, karena jaminan dilindungi oleh pihak bank. Bahkan, sangat jarang terjadi fraud. Tiket.com mengalami chargeback kartu kredit terakhir adalah bulan Agustus 2014 tahun lalu (satu tahun yang lalu, dan hanya satu kartu), dan itu dikarenakan kartu kredit komersil/korporat, dimana semua kartu kredit komersil walau 3DS tidak ada jaminan Shifted Liability.

3. Jika terjadi fraud, uang anda kembali 100%!
Jika kartu anda sudah 3D Secure, maka jika terjadi fraud, uang anda akan dikembalikan 100%! Yang diwajibkan untuk mengembalikan uang tersebut adalah pihak merchant atau pihak bank issuer.

4. Proses 3D Secure di Indonesia Berbentuk OTP
Hampir semua Issuing Bank di Indonesia menggunakan OTP, dan ini meningkatkan keamanan transaksi Anda berkali-kali lipat.

Ini dikarenakan PIN yang digunakan untuk mengotentikasi pemegang kartu kredit di-generate secara acak. Nomer PIN ini dikirimkan melalui SMS.Di Amerika, masih banyak proses 3D Secure yang menggunakan password sebagai lapisan perlindungannya. Masalahnya password itu statis, tidak berubah-ubah. Andaikata password anda kebobolan, maka kemungkinan besar kartu anda bisa digunakan oleh carder.

Bagaimana mereka mendapatkan password Anda? Dengan menggunakan teknik phishing. Anda secara tidak sadar mendapatkan email dan diminta untuk mengakses situs resmi yang sebenarnya dibuat oleh carder dan diminta untuk memasukkan data-data kartu kredit anda. Contoh phishing bisa dilihat disini: http://www.millersmiles.co.uk/identitytheft/121504-Visa-Verified-by-Visa.php

Kenapa masih banyak fraud online?
Okay, ini fakta pahitnya. Di dunia e-commerce, 3D Secure ini memiliki nama panggilan Conversion Killer. Situs Judopay mengatakan, tanpa 3DS, jumlah declined transaction hanya 7%. Namun jika menggunakan 3DS, maka jumlah declined transaction menjadi 17%.

Ini dikarenakan beberapa hal seperti:

Customer tidak tahu apa itu 3D Secure, sehingga kebingungan ketika memasuki halaman 3D Secure ini. Sebagai informasi, tampilan input 3D Secure di website datang langsung dari situs Bank Issuer, sehingga tampilan dan cara melindungi pelanggan berbeda-beda. Rata-rata bank di Indonesia menggunakan OTP, berupa SMS yang dikirimkan ke nomor ponsel, namun bank seperti HSBC malah menghubungi customer langsung melalui telepon. Jika customer mengangkat dan mengkonfirmasikan transaksi tersebut, tiba-tiba secara otomatis tampilan halaman 3D Secure berpindah dan transaksi menjadi sukses.
Ponsel sedang mati atau sedang tidak dekat dengan ponsel. Sehingga ketika SMS dikirim ke nomer ponsel, kita tidak mendapatkannya dan tidak cukup waktu untuk memasukkannya ke tampilan 3D Secure. Rata-rata tampilan 3D Secure ini hanya memberikan waktu sekitar 2 menit untuk memasukkan OTP.
Internet tidak stabil atau situs bank issuer bermasalah, sehingga tampilan 3D Secure tidak keluar. Seperti yang diungkapkan sebelumnya, tampilan 3D Secure datang dari situs issuing bank, sehingga secara tidak langsung mengakses situs lain di luar situs e-commerce yang sedang dikunjungi. Resiko menjadi bertambah besar, karena bisa saja tampilannya gagal tampil karena internet lagi lambat, atau lokasi server issuing bank tidak dekat dengan kita, sehingga untuk mengakses halaman 3D Secure tersebut menjadi sangat lambat.
SMS tidak terkirim dengan benar, atau nomer PIN lupa atau belum pernah di-set. Sering juga OTP yang dikirimkan melalui SMS tidak sampai ke pengguna, atau karena ada masalah jaringan, SMS tidak sampai dengan cepat, padahal halaman 3D Secure biasanya memiliki hitung mundur sekitar 2 menit, sehingga jika kita tidak cepat-cepat memasukkannya maka akan otomatis digagalkan transaksinya oleh pihak bank. Bahkan saya pernah mendengar beberapa bank yang tidak bisa mengirimkan SMS karena SMS gateway-nya sedang down/rusak.
Mobile device seperti iPhone atau Android terkadang me-refresh situs yang sedang kita akses jika kita berpindah-pindah aplikasi. Karena OTP dikirim melalui SMS, maka kita terkadang harus membuka aplikasi SMS/Messenger agar bisa melihat isi dari SMS tersebut. Apesnya, ketika kita berpindah kembali ke browser, terkadang browser me-refresh ulang halaman yang sedang kita akses, sehingga menjadi error dan dilempar kembali ke halaman awal checkout page.
Banyak sekali ya masalahnya, tapi ini yang harus dibayar jika merchant ingin melindungi konsumennya.

Nah kembali ke pertanyaan awal, kenapa koq masih ada fraud? Jawabannya:

3D Secure bisa dinonaktifkan oleh merchant!

Yup! 3D Secure di situs e-commerce adalah pilihan, belum menjadi kewajiban. Untuk merchant yang ingin profitnya tidak turun, tentunya tidak ingin kehilangan potensi konversi gara-gara masalah-masalah 3D Secure tersebut.

Sedangkan untuk merchant yang mengaktifkan 3D Secure, tentunya tujuannya bukan fokus ke profit, namun lebih untuk mengutamakan keamanan dan kenyamanan customer dalam berbelanja. Oleh karena itu Tiket.com sudah ZERO CHARGEBACK selama lebih dari setahun. Tidak pernah ada konsumen yang kartunya digunakan secara illegal di Tiket.com.Lalu Bagaimana Carder Mendapatkan Kartu Saya?
Untuk menjelaskan ini, silahkan baca ilustrasi berikut:

Anda sedang bercengkerama di restoran bebek ternama bersama teman-teman anda. Karena Anda baik, Anda yang membayar bill-nya untuk teman-teman Anda. Sang waitress datang menunjukkan bill dan Anda menyerahkan kartu kredit Anda.

Sang waitress kembali ke mesin kasir dan menggesek kartu Anda. Waitress datang kembali ke Anda untuk meminta tanda tangan Anda di atas lembar receipt yang dicetak oleh mesin EDC bank. Anda menanda tangan dan waitress mengucapkan terima kasih.

Disini potensi pencurian informasi kartu kredit terjadi. Ketika waitress pergi ke mesin kasir untuk menggesek kartu kredit di mesin EDC, waitress cukup memotret tampak depan dan belakang kartu kredit Anda. Semua informasi untuk bertransaksi kartu kredit secara online terdapat di kartu kredit tersebut!

Tahukah Anda informasi apa yang dibutuhkan untuk bertransaksi kartu kredit secara online? Hanya tiga!

Nomor kartu berupa 16 digit yang tertera di bagian depan
Expiry kartu yang juga tertera di bagian depan
CVV/CV2/CVN/CID/CSC berupa 3 digit yang tertera di bagian belakang
Apakah informasi nama pemegang kartu digunakan untuk verifikasi? Tidak. Anda bisa menulis asal nama apa saja, sistem bank tidak memeriksanya.

Apakah informasi alamat pemegang kartu digunakan untuk verifikasi? Tidak. Tidak ada verifikasi dari sistem bank untuk alamat. Anda bisa menulis asal alamat apa saja.

Katanya ada yang namanya AVS (Address Verification System), bukankah alamat diperiksa oleh sistem bank? Tidak. AVS hanya berlaku di Amerika Serikat, Kanada dan United Kingdom. Dan sebenarnya sistem AVS hanya menangkap numerik dari alamat yang anda ketikkan. Jadi semisal alamat anda Ruko Plaza Margaguna No. 3 Gandaria Utara, Kebayoran Baru, Jakarta Selatan, DKI Jakarta 12140, maka yang disimpan oleh sistem AVS adalah angka 3 dan 12140.

Jadi, carder cukup mendapatkan tiga seri angka (card number, expiry number, CVV number) untuk bisa bertransaksi online. Shocking, isn’t it?

Oleh karena itu saya selalu mengatakan, jika terjadi carding di online, kemungkinan besar carder mendapatkan informasi kartunya secara offline.

Sangat sulit untuk melakukan pencurian data kartu kredit secara online. Bahkan merchant atau situs e-commerce TIDAK PERNAH menyimpan data kartu kredit Anda. Yang memproses adalah payment gateway.

Pro Tips untuk Menghindari Resiko Carding
Lalu bagaimana caranya agar saya terlindungi dari resiko pencurian data oleh carder? Berikut tips-tipsnya:

Pastikan Anda mengaktifkan 3D Secure. Jika anda pengguna kartu kredit terbitan Indonesia, sudah dipastikan Anda terdaftar.
Pastikan Anda mengaktifkan PIN kartu kredit Anda. Ini untuk melindungi Anda seandainya ada yang mencuri kartu kredit Anda dan digunakan untuk bertransaksi. Lebih asiknya lagi, Anda sudah tidak perlu tanda tangan. Lagipula tanda tangan tersebut tidak pernah diperiksa oleh bank. Tanda tangan baru diperiksa jika ada kasus fraud.
Pastikan Anda selalu mendampingi kartu kredit Anda. Jangan menyerahkan kartu kredit Anda ke kasir atau waitress. Ikutlah ke kasir untuk mengawasi kartu kredit Anda. Jangan beri kesempatan untuk mereka mencatat 3 seri angka di kartu kredit anda. Kejahatan terjadi karena adanya kesempatan.
Pastikan Anda bertransaksi di situs e-commerce yang mengaktifkan 3D Secure dan yang berlogo Verified by Visa dan MasterCard SecureCode. Situs dengan logo ini sangat mengutamakan kenyamanan dan keamanan kartu kredit Anda ketimbang mengejar profit dan conversion. Situs tanpa 3D Secure merupakan surga bagi carder.Mungkin beberapa dari Anda berkomentar bahwa dari tulisan ini, carder menjadi tahu bahwa cukup tiga seri angka, carder bisa melakukan carding. Yang perlu Anda ketahui, semua informasi ini tersedia secara online di Internet, dan komunitas carder sudah tahu tentang ini semua.

Apesnya, konsumen pemegang kartu kredit banyak sekali yang tidak tahu. Malahan mungkin Anda baru tahu banyak hal tentang kartu kredit ini. Oleh karena itu bantu saya sebarkan pengetahuan ini agar pengguna kartu kredit di Indonesia menjadi semakin cerdas.

Namun yang pasti, di Indonesia, pengguna kartu kredit itu sudah seperti raja, sangat-sangat dilindungi oleh Bank Indonesia. Dengan perlindungan nomor PIN kartu kredit dan 3DS, kartu kredit terbitan Indonesia saya jamin sudah sangat-sangat aman!",Pengalaman Pribadi
45,Skripsi Adalah Seni,11/16/2019,Ismawati Nurjannah,https://medium.com/@isma-jannah/skripsi-adalah-seni-920f4d34aadf,"Cerita yang saya tulis ini merupakan pengalaman pribadi saya selama proses mengerjakan skripsi dan saya harap dapat memberikan sebuah insight untukmu agar tidak lagi takut dengan si Skripsi ini.

Skripsi merupakan tulisan karya ilmiah bagi mahasiswa untuk mendapatkan gelar S1 di mana membahas mengenai suatu permasalahan mau pun fenomena yang terjadi. Pada dasarnya, skripsi berisikan latar belakang, rumusan masalah, metodologi penelitan, pengujian, pembahasan, dan kesimpulan. Nampak sederhana kan?

Namun, sayangnya tidak semudah itu. Beberapa kendala tentang skripsi pasti akan terjadi, contohnya:

Belum menemukan topik yang sesuai.
Sudah menemukan topik tapi bingung implementasinya.
Poin pertama dapat diselesaikan dengan banyak membaca, tidak ada cara instan lainnya selain perbanyak membaca jurnal mau pun skripsi kakak tingkat. Banyak membaca akan memperluas sudut pandangmu tentang topik yang akan kamu pilih nantinya. Namun, jika ada dosen yang membuka topik skripsi, kamu bisa coba konsultasi lebih lanjut dan masih harus melakukan research terkait topik yang diajukan. Topik yang ditawarkan oleh dosen bukan berarti kamu akan disuapi dan diarahakan 100% tapi kamu harus inisiatif dengan skripsimu. Beliau memfasilitasi namun bukan berarti mendikte kamu. Skripsimu adalah tanggung jawabmu.

Poin kedua seringkali memakan banyak waktu dan tenaga. Pada awalnya sudah yakin dengan topik yang akan dipakai, bahkan sudah ada bayangan bagaimana melakukan pengujian namun masih buntu mengenai cara implementasinya. Masalah yang akan timbul seperti; belum menemukan tools yang sesuai, aplikasi yang nge-bug, bahkan tidak tahu bagaimana menuliskan barisan kode yang kamu inginkan.

Beberapa dosen pada keminatan saya menyarankan untuk memastikan dahulu bahwa kamu siap dan sanggup di bagian implementasi sebelum fokus pada penulisan skripsi. Jadi, dalami dan coba terus sampai berhasil di bagian implementasi dan pahami tools yang akan kamu pakai.

“Skripsi dalam ranah S1 adalah bagaimana kita dapat menggunakan teori-teori yang telah kita pelajari selama kuliah sebagai dasar dalam menjawab rumusan masalah.” Kurang lebih begitulah sabda salah satu dosen pembimbingku.

Lalu di mana sisi seni di dalam skripsi?

Menata pola pikir dan logika.
Saya sangat beruntung dapat dibimbing oleh Pak Abas dan Pak Kasyful dalam menyusun skripsi saya. Beliau-beliau secara tidak langsung menata pola pikir saya. Ketika menyusun skripsi, saya harus menata ulang pola pikir menjadi lebih sistematis dan sederhana. Salah satu seni yang saya dapatkan adalah bagaimana tulisan mampu menyederhanakan apa yang rumit, bukan merumitkan apa yang sederhana. Skripsi dibuat agar bermanfaat bagi pembacanya bukan hanya bagi penulis.

2. Meningkatkan kemampuan berpikir kritis.

Dalam penyusunan skripsi, saya pernah merasa sedih ketika diminta pembimbing saya untuk lebih berpikir kritis. Saya merasa sangat bodoh dan buta akan skripsi saya sendiri. Di satu sisi, saya merasa tertantang oleh ucapan beliau hehe… Saya menjadi penasaran, apa sih yang masih belum saya temukan pada skripsi saya? Apa yang masih missing di dalam tulisan saya?

Cara yang saya pakai adalah melakukan PDKT dengan tulisan saya sendiri. Berkali-kali saya membaca tulisan saya, berkali-kali saya harus menerima revisi tulisan. Menulis bab 1 saja saya butuh berbulan-bulan, belum lagi menyatukan bab 1,2 dan 3. Semisal ada revisi di bab 3, maka bab 1 dan 2 juga berdampak. Memperbaiki di salah satu bab artinya harus memperbaiki di seluruh bab. Tulisan pada skripsi harus kompak, satu suara, satu tujuan, tidak boleh ada missing link.

3. Meningkatkan kemampuan menulis.

Menulis tidak sekadar menggabungkan kata-kata, tapi bagaimana tulisan tersebut terstruktur dan baik, sehingga pembaca / lawan komunikasi kita akan mudah menangkap maksud kita. Tulisan yang kita buat, entah itu pesan Whatsapp, status Facebook, bahkan caption foto Instagram menjadi mudah tersampaikan. Perlahan namun pasti, dengan tulisan yang baik akan membuat kita berkomunikasi lebih baik dan mengurangi kesalah-pahaman atau miss communication.

4. Memaksamu untuk lebih teliti dan tidak mudah berpuas diri.

Satu hal yang paling tricky dalam menulis skripsi adalah…. format! Perhatikan betul format-format sesuai dengan buku panduan skripsimu. Hal ini memang seringkali terlewatkan atau lebih seringnya…diremehkan. Teliti lagi format caption tabel, gambar, dan lain-lainnya. Cek kembali daftar isimu, sesuaikan dan perbarui tiap kali melakukan revisi penulisan.

Pengalaman bodoh yang bahkan saya cukup malu mengakuinya adalah, saya tidak teliti dalam menuliskan judul skripsi saya di halaman pengesahan. Sehingga, skripsi saya yang sudah terjilid dengan cantik harus diperbaiki kembali dan meminta tanda tangan pembimbing serta ketua jurusan saya.

Jadi, ketika skripsimu sudah kamu yakini oke dan siap untuk dijilid, tolong minta temanmu untuk membaca skripsimu. Karena ketika orang lain yang membaca skripsimu, akan lebih mudah menemukan suatu kesalahan yang luput dari pandanganmu sendiri.

Seperti sebuah peribahasa yang mengatakan, “Gajah di pelupuk mata tak tampak, semut di seberang lautan tampak.”

Pada akhirnya, ketika kamu mulai jatuh cinta dengan skripsimu, kamu akan mulai melihat seni dan keindahan kata-kata dalam tulisan skripsimu. Cara paling mudah untuk menemukan seni dalam suatu hal adalah dengan menyukainya dan menaruh minat yang besar.",Pengalaman Pribadi
46,7 Kelakuan Bodoh yang Nggak Gue Sesali Selama Kuliah,4/2/2017,Bani Syahroni,https://medium.com/banibuzz/7-kelakuan-bodoh-yang-nggak-gue-sesali-selama-kuliah-a25b1bfb6003,"Nggak kerasa udah empat tahun gue kuliah di UI. Banyak banget pengalaman dan pelajaran yang gue dapet baik di kampus maupun di luar itu. Post ini dedikasikan untuk gue yang nggak mau melupakan bagaimana diri gue di saat kuliah dan teman-teman mahasiswa yang mau kehidupan kuliahnya lebih dari sekedar ngampus. Enjoy!

1. Pura-pura berani Kalau pas kalian SMP kalian tau anak yang di kelas sukanya sendirian nggak ada temen, itu gue. Masa-masa SMP resmi jadi masa-masa tersuram gue. Gue hampir nggak punya temen, pulang sekolah langsung pulang terus main game, pokoknya amat tidak bermanfaat deh. Pas SMP gue juga pernah nge-hack beberapa akun Friendster temen-temen gue. Nggak penting banget, kan.

Masuk SMA, gue sadar ada yang harus gue ubah dari diri gue. Dengan kemampuan bersosialisasi gue yang amat terbatas, gue mulai coba nggak langsung pulang selesai kelas, gue coba masuk dan ambil jabatan di organisasi, gue coba ikut kepanitiaan. Hal-hal tersebut gue lakukan dengan penuh perjuangan, terutama secara mental. Dan gue lumayan suka dengan hasilnya. Kehidupan SMA gue jauh lebih baik dari SMP.

Dari situ gue sadar satu hal: gue penakut. Takut orang lain nggak suka sama gue, takut gagal kalau buat rencana, takut ditolak kalau daftar organisasi, dan takut-takut yang sebenarnya cuma asumsi gue doang. Gue terlalu takut buat keluar dari zona nyaman gue. Gue memutuskan buat mengubah itu waktu masuk kuliah.

Di kuliah, gue termasuk mahasiswa yang sering ikut berbagai kegiatan di luar kuliah. Gue ikut kepanitiaan, kompetisi, conference, dan sebagainya. Gue nggak mau jadi mahasiswa yang melewatkan berbagai kesempatan cuma karena gue takut buat ikutan. Apakah gue jadi berani? Nggak, gue tetep takut, gue cuma pura-pura berani.

Gue pura-pura berani buat mulai kenalan sama temen-temen seangkatan gue pas awal kuliah, gue pura-pura berani buat jadi wakil ketua acara terbesar fakultas gue yang budgetnya ratusan juta, gue pura-pura berani buat ikuta lomba business case walau gue nggak punya dasar ilmu manajemen, dan kepura-puraan lainnya. Apakah gue berhasil dengan itu? Kadang ya, kadang nggak. Tapi yang pasti, gue nggak menyesali diri karena gue nggak melewatkan kesempatan itu.

Berpura-puralah berani, cuma diri lu yang tau kalau itu pura-pura.

2. Menahan hedon demi traveling Pengalaman pertama gue naik pesawat adalah saat gue kuliah. Sampai tahun pertama kuliah, gue nggak berpikir kalau traveling adalah hal yang menyenangkan. Gue tau foto-foto di tempat terkenal itu keren, cuma gue nggak berpikir itu menyenangkan. Sampai di tahun kedua nyokap gue nyuruh gue buat bikin paspor, gue disuruh umrah. Jujur awalnya gue ngerasa belum pantes buat menginjak ke rumah Allah, bukan apa-apa, ilmu agama gue nggak sebanyak temen-temen gue. Tapi karena ini permintaan nyokap tercinta, ya jalanin aja.

Gue nggak bakal cerita tentang pengalaman umrah gue, tapi tentang bagaimana gue jatuh cinta sama traveling. Pertama kali gue keluar bandara King Abdul Aziz, gue terpana. Gue nggak nyangka ada tempat yang lebih banyak pasirnya daripada pohon, gue nggak nyangka gue jadi kerdil di antar orang-orang sini, gue nggak nyangka kalau selama ini gue cuma muter-muter di satu daerah sedangkan ada tempat sebeda ini di dunia. Sepulang dari Arab, gue jadi penasaran buat traveling lagi.

Kesukaan gue buat traveling bertambah secara signifikan setelah gue terpilih buat jadi salah satu Google Student Ambassador dan diterbangkan ke Cebu, Filipina buat ikut conference dan pelatihan bersama peserta lain se-Asia Tenggara. Lagi, gue excited melihat tempat-tempat baru. Acara ini sangat spesial buat gue karena ini pertama kalinya gue bisa kenalan sama banyak anak muda dari berbagai negara. Gue jadi merasakan persamaan dan perbedaan budaya saat kita berkomunikasi. Gue nggak nyangka ketemu orang-orang baru bisa semenyenangkan ini.

Sejak saat itu gue menjadikan traveling prioritas dalam hidup gue, dalam satu semester minimal sekali. Nggak mesti ke luar negeri, dalam negeri juga nggak kalah seru. Gue juga rutin nabung dan menahan nggak ke mal atau beli gadget supaya bisa beli peralatan traveling atau tiket kereta.

Traveling bikin gue semakin menghargai manusia karena gue bisa ketemu dan mendengar cerita dari beragam orang mulai dari beda warna kulit, beda agama, beda orientasi seksual, dan lain-lain. Traveling bikin gue iri sama nenek moyang gue yang hidupnya nomaden dan bisa berpetualang ke berbagai tempat baru. Dan yang paling penting, traveling bikin gue semakin bersyukur dan sadar betapa besarnya Allah SWT yang menciptakan sebuah dunia yang beragam dengan tempat-tempat indah.

Kalau lu punya uang, jangan beli barang, beli pengalaman. Anak lu bakal lebih tertarik denger cerita lu berpetualang ke Galapagos daripada denger cerita lu beli iPhone di Roxy Mas pas kuliah.

3. Menikmati kegagalan Gue lulus SMA di tahun 2011, gue masuk UI tahun 2012, dan waktu di antaranya adalah salah satu tahun yang paling berharga buat gue. Perjalanan gue masuk UI nggak selancar orang lain. Gue harus gagal empat kali seleksi sampai akhirnya bisa melihat kata “Selamat” di halaman pengumuman. Empat kali gagal, empat kali kecewa. Gue susah menerima fakta bahwa gue nggak cukup baik buat mencapai mimpi gue. Dari tahun 2011 sampai 2012 gue kuliah di salah satu kampus swasta di Bandung sambil mempersiapkan buat seleksi lagi ke UI. Siapa sangka, masa-masa ini adalah waktu di mana gue menekan diri gue paling keras yang alhamdulillah terbayarkan dengan berhasil masuk UI.

Dari situ gue belajar satu hal, gue harus berdamai sama kegagalan. Kegagalan bukan sesuatu yang harus dihindari, tetapi diperbanyak. Bukan berarti kita nggak niat dalam melakukan berbagai hal supaya gagal, ya. Melakukan yang terbaik adalah kewajiban, tapi buat berhasil itu banyak faktor lain yang ikut menentukan. Kita boleh menyesal karena nggak melakukan yang terbaik, tapi kita nggak boleh menyesal karena kita gagal.

Selama kuliah, gue sering banget gagal. Gagal menang kompetisi, gagal lolos ikutan conference, gagal magang, dan gagal-gagal lainnya. Gue nggak menyesal, sama sekali. Gue bahkan buat label khusus di email gue buat tandai email-email yang berisi kegagalan atau penolakan buat gue. Gue nggak mau mengukur hidup gue cuma dari apa yang gue dapet, tapi dari apa yang gue udah coba buat perjuangin. Bukan berarti gue jingkrak-jingkrakan kalau tau gue gagal, gue pasti sedih, tapi nggak lama. Gue terlalu sibuk mencari kegagalan lain sampai nggak punya waktu buat sedih.

Gagal bikin gue belajar kalau masih banyak yang harus gue pelajari dan perbaiki. Gagal bikin gue bisa berempati sama orang lain, bikin gue nggak mau menyombongkan apa yang gue dapet ke orang lain. Gagal bikin gue bersyukur punya keluarga dan temen-temen yang tetep menghibur dan semangatin gue. Gagal bikin gue yakin kalau gue ada di jalan yang benar, bikin gue yakin kalau gue tetep terus mengejar tantangan baru dan bukan mengambil jalan yang mudah.

Setiap orang punya jatah gagal, habiskan jatah gagalmu ketika kamu masih muda. (Dahlan Iskan)

4. Jadi butiran debu Pas gue masih kuliah di Bandung, gue pernah ngajak salah satu temen gue buat ikutan seleksi SNMPTN lagi, itung-itung cari temen buat belajar bareng. Terus dia bilang, dia nggak mau pindah karena ngerasa “lebih baik jadi kepala kucing daripada ekor harimau” (oke yang ini gue lupa harimau apa gajah atau naga). Gue setuju sih. Waktu itu gue mikir juga, kalau gue kuliah di UI belum tentu nilai-nilai gue bisa bagus dan menonjol kayak di sini (yang mana memang kenyataannya begitu hiks). Tapi, hey! Kenapa harus membatasi diri kita jadi kepala kucing kalau kita bisa jadi kepala harimau (atau gajah atau naga), kan?

Di tahun ketiga kuliah di UI, gue ikutan program XL Future Leaders (XLFL). Ini adalah program CSR-nya XL Axiata buat mengembangkan kepemimpinan anak-anak muda di Indonesia, dan menurut gue program ini sangat-sangaat-sangaaat bagus (terbaik malah). Kalau gue jelasin di sini bisa panjang jadi boleh cek website resminya aja di sini. Di angkatan gue, pendaftar program ini ada 13 ribu dari seluruh Indonesia dan yang diterima adalah 145. Awalnya gue rada bangga karena bisa masuk ke program ini. Tapi setelah bertemu temen-temen peserta lain, gue jiper.

Peserta-peserta program XLFL ini sadis banget menurut gue. Ada yang bahasa Inggrisnya casciscusces, ada yang pernah exchange ke mana-mana, ada yang pernah conference ke mana-mana, ada yang pernah menang banyak kompetisi. Macem-macem deh. Jujur pas di acara national conference di mana gue ketemu semua peserta gue ngerasa “duh, aku mah apa atuh, cuma bubuk bedak yang jatuh ke lantai karena nggak nempel ke kulit.”

Setelah beberapa bulan menjalani program itu, somehow gue malah suka. Gue jadi termotivasi buat lebih banyak mencapai sesuatu. Di saat grup Line XLFL ada yang ucapin “selamat ya jadi mapres” atau “selamat ya juara ini”, gue jadi semangat buat melakukan lebih banyak. Jadi butiran debu nggak bikin gue ngerasa lebih kecil, tapi bikin gap antara gue dan orang-orang hebat tadi lebih kecil.

Jadi butiran debu juga bikin gue belajar buat nggak ngebanding-bandingin diri gue sama orang lain. Walaupun gue tau menyebut diri gue butiran debu juga sebenernya termasuk ngebandingin sih haha. Justru gue belajar dari situ. Permasalahannya adalah, ngebanding-bandingin diri kita sama orang lain tuh nggak akan ada habisnya, dan waktu yang kita habiskan buat ngebanding-bandingin adalah waktu yang sebenernya bisa kita pakai buat bahagia. Hidup itu kompetisi, tapi bukan dengan orang lain, melainkan dengan diri kita di waktu kemarin.

Kelilingi diri lu dengan orang-orang hebat, tetapi jangan banding-bandingin diri lu sama mereka. Lu nggak akan sadar betapa waktu sangat singkat sampai lu bisa jadi seperti mereka.

5. Mempertanyakan eksistensi diri Di saat masuk semester 8, gue merasakan kegalauan yang amat sangat. Gue galau mau ngapain setelah lulus. Gue galau harus kerja di mana dan jadi apa. Gue galau sebenernya gue hidup buat apa. Gue galau apakah gue akan bahagia nanti. Kata orang ini namanya quarter life crisis. Gue merasa sistem pendidikan membuat gue nggak mempersiapkan ini. Masuk SMP, tujuan dapet nilai bagus supaya masuk SMA bagus. Masuk SMA, tujuan dapet nilai bagus supaya masuk universitas bagus. Lulus universitas? Pilihannya luaas banget.

Gue pernah diwawancara buat masuk sebuah perusahaan multinasional IT. Di akhir wawancara, si bapak pewawancara tanya ke gue apakah gue punya pertanyaan. Terus gue nanya, “Kalau di usia seperti bapak sekarang, bahagia itu apa, sih?”

Awalnya bapaknya diem, tapi terus gue curhat deh tentang kegalauan gue dan kita jadi bicara panjang tentang karir dan kehidupan. Tentang pilihan hidup, tentang keluarga, dan nilai yang mau kita pegang. Sesi wawancara sukses bergeser jadi sesi konseling gratisan.

Gue jadi suka tanya-tanya pengalaman orang-orang yang udah kerja tentang bagaimana mereka memilih jalan hidup dan apakah mereka menikmatinya. Gue bahkan beli buku judulnya “101 Secrets for Your Twenties” di Google Play buat cari tahu gimana kehidupan di usia 20an. Gue juga suka tanya-tanya dan sharing sama temen-temen seangkatan yang udah pada mau lulus tentang rencana hidup mereka.

Sampai sekarang gue masih galau sih, tapi perjuangan gue buat cari tahu membuat gue lebih tenang karena seenggaknya gue memikirkannya sekarang, bukan nanti-nanti.

6. Menertawakan diri sendiri Gue lebih sering ngelawak dengan menertawakan diri sendiri. Entah menertawakan kamar kosan gue yang berantakan, perut gue yang buncit, atau kebegoan-kebegoan gue di masa lalu. Alesannya simpel sih, gue nggak mau orang menganggap gue nggak approachable karena gue terlalu serius.

Temen-temen gue mungkin ngecap gue ambisius, tapi gue nggak mau mereka jadi males atau enggan buat sekedar ngobrol atau tanya-tanya sama gue. Menertawakan diri sendiri bikin tembok penghalang itu hilang.

The more you make fun of yourself and don’t try to go for any kind of respect, the more people seem to respect you. (James Van Der Beek)

7. Kerja tanpa dibayar Magang pertama gue adalah di sebuah digital agency multinasional di Jakarta selama dua bulan, tanpa dibayar. Awalnya sebenernya karena pas wawancara mereka pikir gue mau jadi karyawan tetap, padahal masih semester empat. Terus mereka tawarin mau nggak magang dua bulan selama liburan tapi enggak di bayar. Karena waktu itu gue lagi gencar-gencarnya belajar digital marketing, gue iyain deh. Dan emang pas gue kerja gue jadi belajar banyak tentang itu, bahkan pelajaran-pelajaran kehidupan seperti desek-desekan di kereta dan transjakarta setiap hari dan gimana bergaul sama orang-orang yang umurnya lebih tua.

Menurut gue, selama kehidupan kita masih dibiayain orang tua seperti pas kuliah, kerja tanpa dibayar selama ngasih manfaat yang setimpal buat kita itu nggak apa-apa. Selama kuliah, gue sering jadi volunteer di acara-acara komunitas teknologi atau seputar UX. Keuntungan yang gue dapet dari situ adalah jadi tambah temen dan kenalan.

Bulan Desember 2015 kemarin gue coba ikutan kegiatan volunteering selama seminggu di Kuala Lumpur dengan volunteer dari negara-negara Asia Tenggara. Selama seminggu itu kita diharusin buat jadi volunteer di beberapa kegiatan sosial di sana. Kegiatannya emang bikin capek sih tapi gue dapet pengalaman berharga banget.

Salah satu yang paling gue inget adalah saat gue dan peserta lain harus masak 1000 porsi makanan dari siang sampai sore di sebuah sekolahan, terus tengah malemnya kita berpencar di Kuala Lumpur buat bagiin makanan ke homeless-homeless di sana. Bayangin gue yang di Bogor ngasih uang ke pengemis aja jarang di sana jam 12 malem harus keliling-kelling Chinatown sambil bawa-bawa nasi kotak buat dibagi-bagiin. Lebih dari itu, gue juga jadi temenan sama peserta-peserta dari Indonesia maupun negara-negara lain.

Saat lu memilih buat kerja tanpa dibayar, seringkali apa yang lu dapatkan lebih berharga dari uang.

Penutup

Masa-masa kuliah adalah waktu terbaik buat kita mengembangkan diri dengan beban dan risiko yang relatif kecil. Pastikan kita memanfaatkan waktu ini dengan sebaik-baiknya, dan pastinya jangan lupa buat bersenang-senang :)",Pengalaman Pribadi
47,Belajar Skill Ga Harus Lewat Kuliah,9/3/2018,Iqbal Hariadi,https://medium.com/@iqbalhariadi/belajar-skill-ga-harus-lewat-kuliah-c434978f761,"Saya berbagi tentang 3 prinsip pilar yang saya pegang untuk optimasi Marketing menggunakan konten, baik untuk meningkatkan sales maupun branding. Saya juga sertakan data dan insight dari pengalaman saya menjalankan content marketing selama >3 tahun di Kitabisa.com. Saya orang yang sangat suka sharing. Selain karena saya orangnya memang banci panggung, saya merasa ini cara saya untuk giveback.

Dulu saya kuliah biologi, bukan ekonomi atau bisnis. Saya orang yang belajar marketing secara otodidak. Saya membaca buku, melahap artikel dan tutorial, mendengar podcast, menonton video, dan aktif ikut seminar / meetup komunitas.

Di kelas-kelas dan komunitas inilah saya curi curi ilmu dari para suhu rendah hati yang mau berbagi. Untuk digital marketing, beberapa diantaranya misalnya Maula Al-Haq, Iqbal Maulana, dan Adryan Fitra. Karena dengerin mereka di kelas-kelas informal inilah, saya bisa menyelam lebih dalam di ilmu yang sebelumnya ga pernah saya pelajari. Sekarang belajar marketing atau skill baru seperti socmed dan content sangat bisa dilakukan otodidak atau mengikuti kelas-kelas nonformal yang bertebaran. Komunitas online dan offline makin ramai, kelas-kelas untuk profesi dan skill khusus pun makin banyak. Apalagi di kota besar kayak Jakarta.

Kalo kamu tertarik, bisa cek beberapa platform/web berikut:

Lingkaran.co (komunitas edukasi skill terutama untuk industri kreatif)
Maubelajarapa.com (marketplace workshop dan kelas dengan beragam tema)
Eventbrite.com (Marketplace event, dari yang gratis sampe berbayar, bisa search by location dan interest)
Meetup.com (Marketplace komunitas yang suka bikin kegiatan offline)
Intinya ga ada lagi alasan buat ga berani belajar skill baru, karena pilihannya makin banyak dan makin mudah. Ga selalu harus lewat sekolah atau kuliah. Semua bisa dengan cara otodidak + arahan mentor yang memang praktisi di bidangnya.

48,Kata-kata itu sebenernya tidak bisa menyakiti,11/30/2022,Ery Prihananto,https://medium.com/@eryprihananto/kata-kata-itu-sebenernya-tidak-bisa-menyakiti-90213fa430dc,"Saya kok tiba-tiba teringat di sekitar tahun 2009 atau 2010, kayanya 2009 deh, selepas SMA saya sempat cuti 1 tahun sebelum lanjut kuliah. Awalnya pas cuti ini saya isi cuma buat main sepeda doang, wkwkwk.. tapi bosen juga akhirnya. Karena bosen coba-coba cari kerja dan waktu itu dapet kerja di sebuah pabrik pembuat speaker

Singkat cerita saya waktu itu pernah diomeli sama bos yang asalnya dari korea. Waktu itu saya diomeli karena saya naik ke lantai 2, yang secara peraturan pekerja di lantai 1 gak boleh naik ke lantai 2. Waktu itu saya nekat naik ke lantai 2 karena trolley untuk angkut barang di lantai satu sudah habis dan belum diturunkan dari lantai 2. Hal ini menyebabkan “belt” (yang kalau pernah liat di tv produk2 jalan di atas belt itu, hehe) sampai harus dimatikan karena barang bertumpuk di ujung

Nah kebetulan saya kebagian tugas di paling ujung itulah. Melihat kekacauan di lantai bawah, saya inisiatif naik ke lantai 2 untuk menurunkan trolley. Pas saya sibuk nurunin trolley ke bawah pakai lift, eh si bos korea ini pas lagi keliling, saya ditanya ngapain di atas? oh iya walau orang korea dia bisa bahasa Indonesia. Saya jelasin lah, eh dia malah marah-marahin saya pakai bahasa korea, sambil bilang kalau pekerja di lantai bawah gak boleh naik ke sini. Pas dimarah-marahin pakai bahasa korea saya cuma diem aja, dalam hati “ngomong apaan sih ni orang, wkwkwk”. Pas udah selesai marah-marah, saya pun turun dengan rasa agak sedikit kesal, bukan karena dimarahinnya, lha wong saya gak ngerti artinya, namun kata supervisor katanya dia maki-maki pakai bahasa korea, wkwkwk.. tp sayanya gak sakit hati sama sekali, ya itu karena gak ngerti

Saya sedikit kesal bukan karena makiannya, tapi karena kan di bawah crowded banget ya, saya inisiatif biar gak crowded dan produksi bisa terus jalan (karena kan nanti kalau produksi terhambat dia marah-marah lagi, bahkan bisa marah-marah ke 1 lantai di bawah, wkwkwk). Eh inisiatif saya malah kena marah-marah :D

Hal itu bener-bener gak make sense buat saya, gak lama saya pun keluar dari pabrik itu, wkwkwk.. Emang udah ada bakat-bakat gak cocok kerja di kantor dan dibawahi sama bos, wehehe

—

Lalu apa hubungannya sama judul tulisan ini. Saya jadi bertanya-tanya, kalau waktu saya diomeli waktu itu pakai bahasa Indonesia mungkin saya akan tersinggung dan marah, tapi karena saya gak ngerti bahasa korea, saya selow aja dan gak baper sama sekali.

Tapi intinya kan sama ya, waktu diomeli pakai bahasa korea tetep aja maki-maki saya secara kasar. Jadi seharusnya sama ketika ada orang yang maki-maki atau mencela atau menghina atau mengata-ngatain kita pakai bahasa Indonesia atau bahasa yang kita mengerti, kita harusnya gak tersinggung. Karena kata-kata itu sebenernya tidak bisa menyakiti kita. Karena kata-kata itu kan gak ada wujudnya.

Saya istilahkan kata-kata itu kaya yang percaya angka 13 atau angka 4 itu sial atau angka 9 dan 8 yang bawa keberuntungan. Saya paling gak percaya sama hal-hal kaya gini, karena menurut saya gak make sense. Angka 13 dan angka 4 itu non wujud, beda kalau misal kita lagi jalan terus tiba-tiba ngeliat macan, itu kita bisa muncul rasa takut, tapi angka? Masa iya takut sama angka. Sama juga sama angka-angka yang dianggap bawa keberuntungan, angka bos angka.

Begitu juga dengan kata-kata makian, dia seperti angka-angka itu, tidak bisa menyakiti kita, kecuali kita yang membiarkan kata-kata itu menyakiti hati kita. Next ada yang ngatain, ngehina lu, inget hal ini, jangan biarkan kata-kata itu masuk dan “menyakiti” mu",Pengalaman Pribadi
49,"Chase Your Dreams Today, Not Tomorrow",2/9/2023,Holly Riordan,https://thoughtcatalog.com/holly-riordan/2021/09/chase-your-dreams-today-not-tomorrow/,"Stop waiting until tomorrow to start pursuing your dreams. There’s no reason to wait when you can take the first step toward your goals today. Remember, you’re allowed to start small. You don’t have to take a huge, life-changing leap. You can take minuscule (but necessary) steps toward a brighter future. And you can start right now. You owe it to yourself to chase after your dreams. If you never try, then you’re going to be weighed down by your regrets. You’re always going to wonder how your life would’ve turned out if you actually took a chance on yourself. Don’t let that happen. Don’t let your future self be disappointed by your present self. You have so much potential hidden inside yourself, and you deserve to explore it. You don’t have to sit around, daydreaming about what you might do in the future. You can take action right now. You can do anything you want to do, and you can do it today.

It doesn’t matter how old you are or how many people have warned you that you’re never going to succeed. Even the most successful people have had their doubts about whether they had what it took to make it in their field. Even though it’s hard, you need to ignore the doubts in the back of your mind. Ignore the fear stopping you in your tracks. Ignore the haters who are only bringing you down to feel better about themselves.

At the end of the day, you need to do whatever makes you the happiest. Carve out a path for yourself that will lead to the most satisfaction. If you allow your fear to get the best of you, you’re never going to forgive yourself. You need to move past your insecurities and explore your full potential. It’s what you would encourage your friends to do, so why aren’t you giving yourself that same push? Remember, this doesn’t mean you need to give up your day job. This doesn’t mean you need to give up the stable life you’ve already built for yourself. Sometimes, following your dreams means carving out a little bit of time to pursue your passion each day. Sometimes, it means a slight shift in your schedule. You don’t have to give up everything to follow your gut. You can try to balance your dreams with the life you have now. If it goes well, then you can continue shifting.

Don’t let anyone talk you out of pursuing your dreams — especially yourself. You need to trust yourself. Believe in yourself. Take a chance on yourself. Ask yourself what would be worse. If you tried and failed and tried again, or if you never found out what you were truly capable of achieving.

Chase after your dreams, even if that means you might face rejection. Chase after your dreams, even though that means you might need to break out of your comfort zone. Chase after your dreams, even though it means entering the unknown.",Pengalaman Pribadi
50,It’s Okay To Feel Deeply,8/3/2021,Amira Abdel-Fadil,https://thoughtcatalog.com/amira-abdel-fadil/2021/08/its-okay-to-feel-deeply/,"Growing up, I was a sensitive kid. I would feel things at extreme magnitudes. Pain and happiness were equally overwhelming. The lows were really low and the highs were really high. It was a double edged sword. But at least I was learning about myself and I felt alive. It was a blessing and a curse, because while I had to deal with my everyday life like everyone else, my emotions were a really big hurdle to navigate. Oftentimes, I didn’t want to feel them, because they felt like a huge distraction from operating normally.

However, I learned that balance was the best way to go. I had promised myself that no matter what I was feeling, there was a day to be lived. There were things that had to get done. There had to be a choice and a discipline that followed. I couldn’t react to everything that happened around me and let it paralyze me and my productivity. I tried really hard not to let my emotions eat me up. There were times where I suppressed my feelings. I had periods where I felt totally numb and times where my emotions still got the best of me. It’s all really a journey of ups and downs. You just come to a point where you realize that you can still feel deeply and be balanced. You can still be sensitive and resilient. You can still be in deep pain and not break, even when it feels like the end of the world.

It’s not that your feelings became smaller or that they became less intense or valid, but you learn to grow around them. You learn to place them in the big picture. Your thoughts your narrative have the power to put these emotions into perspective, to give them a hug and handle them from a mature lens. At the end of the day, you come to learn that they are just emotions. Just reminding yourself of that tones it down a little. With time, your feelings become more like a compass to show you where you should focus your attention and where you should do the internal work. Ultimately, instead of being your weaknesses, they could become your strengths.To be honest, not feeling doesn’t allow you to reflect on your life. It’s like not knowing how this human experience is going. Are you sad? Scared? In love? Ashamed? Excited? All of our lives, we feel things to some degree and that help us in some way to always get feedback to improve our situation. I don’t think there are good or bad emotions. We should all remember that. All emotions are equally important, and it’s inevitable we’re going to feel them all. Life doesn’t completely shield anyone, and then your feelings mirror your personality to you. Heartbreak is heartbreak, there is no sugar coating losing your parents or being betrayed by a friend or being sad because you’re ill or your country is at war. So let’s normalize being sad just as much as feeling content. Only then can you let yourself be at peace with the process of feeling and observing whatever may arise and ultimately healing.

At the end of the day, when you’re dealing with intense emotions, you should try to use your brain to rationalize and say, “What do we do now? How do we get the engine going forward? Why am I reacting this way and what can I do to improve the situation?” That’s the never-ending dance, utilizing both your heart and mind. So let’s feel and think and navigate our lives using all of our human capacity. You are not a victim. You are powerful beyond measure.",Pengalaman Pribadi
51,10 Ways to Be Eco Friendly as a College Student,5/17/2023,Hana Muslea,https://www.collegemagazine.com/going-green-as-a-college-student/,"Even though April passed, every day is Earth day. The holiday reminds us about the importance of living an environmentally friendly lifestyle and gives us a renewed appreciation for our lovely home. In college, it can feel as though it is difficult to go green, but there exist an abundance of ways you can do your part. You can never start too late.

Both simple and useful, here are 10 way you can be eco-friendly in college:
1. Use an LED Desk light In college, everyone needs a desk lamp for those late-night study sessions when the libraries and study rooms close. Why not use an eco-friendly one? LED desk lights use less electricity compared to incandescent and fluorescent bulbs, making them energy efficient. Not to mention, they last far longer. An LED’s bulb lasts on average 10 times longer than an incandescent bulb. All in all, a great way to go green as a college student.

2. Recycle and Compost Trash conscientiousness may seem a tad trickier in college, but if you make it simple, it will be simple. Even if composting seems difficult, dividing landfill and recycling makes a huge difference. Especially if your college provides the different colored bags and multiple cans per dorm room. Rather than tossing everything in the trash willy-nilly, take that extra second to distinguish between trash and recyclables. It requires such little effort, while having a positive impact.

3. Unplug Even if you do not unplug your charger every single time you walk away from your laptop, phone, kindle etc. there exists alternative habits you can build to help the environment. For instance, making a habit of unplugging before you leave for school. Aka, a time when you won’t need to plug in your devices, which can’t really be avoided when you go to bed and have to recharge them for the day to come. Super simple, right? Starting this as a daily habit acts as a great way to go green as a college student.

4. Bring A Coffee Mug if You Get Coffee on Campus Whether you lend to one, the other or both, everyone needs to hydrate or get caffeinated. To no one’s surprise, in college, the latter typically takes precedence. Either way, the number of plastic bottles or coffee cups adds up super quick. That daily coffee on the way to class soon results in hundreds of cups a year for just one person. Bringing a reusable coffee mug or water bottle can make drastic cuts in plastics.

“I enjoy using a reusable water bottle and a coffee mug because it’s a sturdy, convenient, and eco friendly way to get water or take my coffee to go wherever I need it. It also keeps my drinks more insulated than if I was using a plastic or paper alternative, so I always prefer to use my own cup when I can,” University of San Diego Marine Ecology freshman Evy Melstrand said.

Or simply consider buying a coffee machine for your dorm if the shops on campus won’t take your reusable coffee mug. According to EarthDay.org, using a reusable water bottle means that you can save on average 156 plastic bottles per year. Considering how Americans purchase on average 50 billion water bottles per year, this makes quite the difference. You can even personalize your own mug or cup. It is super simple to make it your own with fun stickers or designs.

5. Walk To Class (if possible) Running late to class? No problem: take a bird or rent an electric bike and you will arrive right on time. I mean, this form of transportation offers a quick and easy option with minimal cost. Or, even better, just walk. Getting to class in ways that cause minimal emissions remains a great way to practice eco-friendly methods in college. Of course, there will eventually come a time where walking may just not get you to class on time, but for the most part, put on your favorite music and enjoy that time outdoors.

6. Share Ubers Ever heard of sharing is caring? Well in this case, sharing is caring for the environment. When you share an Uber you limit the amount of carbon emissions it takes to travel. This way of carpooling helps both the environment and your wallet since the cost will get divided. As a college student, when funds get low and you need to get around just share an Uber. It will help both you and the earth.

“I share Ubers mainly it is cost friendly. Also, it’s a safer option than using public transportation or walking especially at night,” UCLA Pre-Public Affair freshman Nya Palmer said.

“Uber sharing is great for college students because most of us don’t have cars, and it’s an efficient way to save money and time by having the share feature on the app,” San Diego City College freshman Mariela Barbosa said.

Safety equates to importance. When going out on the town, whether to grab food, watch a movie or enjoy a party or two, getting back to campus safe and sound equates to: a priority. Luckily, this priority can coincide with going green in college by carpooling with a reliable driver. Uber offers a low cost and a safe way to get around. A perfect solution for any college student who wants to get around. 7. Turn Off the Lights when you leave the room This may seem like a simple or obvious no brainer. Who doesn’t turn off the lights when leaving a room? Well, it may surprise you. According to ElectronicHouse.com, 90% of Americans said that a member of their household forgets to turn the lights off when they leave a room. Most likely this pattern continues when some house members leave to go live at college. I would leave the hall room light on in my room without thinking much of it, but in actuality such a simple action can reduce carbon emission and other harmful greenhouse gasses.

8. Go Thrifting! (Second Hand Clothes)
As the popular TikTok sounds says, “Get in losers, we’re going shopping.” Who doesn’t love a good shopping spree? More than that, who doesn’t love to go thrifting. The Gen Z popular app recently shined a spotlight on thrifting, making it trendy. It just so happens to also work great for the environment. Looks like a win-win to me.

“I love thrift shopping because one, you never know what you’re gonna find and there are so many interesting pieces that have been thrown away. Two, it’s affordable and environmentally friendly because everything is second hand which means everything that was made in fast fashion sweatshops and then thrown away is put to good use because the fast fashion is so unethical and wasteful and, three, it’s just fun!” ArtCenter College of Design Film and Television Major freshman Tehya Rivette said.

Second hand shopping ultimately acts as a great way to reuse items rather than have them sent straight away to a landfill. It also doesn’t hurt that the clothes tend to get marked down. Cute clothes meet good prices could not be a better combo for the average college student. Let alone for the eco-friendly college student. Now, go get your shop on.

9. Buy a Bamboo Toothbrush When you go to college get yourself a bamboo toothbrush. Need convincing? Here are two great reasons: one, they bring cleanliness benefits as they are anti-microbial. This means they combat bacterium that causes disease. And two, shocking— bamboo comprises the handle of the brush rather than plastic. Overall, a bamboo toothbrush functions as a superior option for both your teeth and the environment. So, if you want to go green, consider this easy option.

10. Water Usage Long story short— shorten those showers. As an eco-friendly college student, you can turn off the water while brushing your teeth rather than leave it running. Try shaving off 5 minutes of your shower time. The United States Environmental Safety Agency shared that it should take on average 8 minutes to effectively clean yourself. If you see yourself exceeding this time quite a bit, consider cutting down. Showers alone result in the usage of more than one trillion gallons of water per year only in the United States.",Pengalaman Pribadi
52,5 Pre-Finals Rituals to Follow for Optimum Study Time,5/12/2023,Noor Zayter,https://www.collegemagazine.com/5-pre-finals-rituals-to-follow-for-optimum-study-time/,"Well, that time of the semester dawns again. Finals rear their ugly heads now that classes draw to a close. Fear not, however, as there exist a few ways to ensure that you make use of every second of studying. Not just how to annotate or how many chapters to take in every day. I think by the time finals roll around, everybody knows what works for them, right?

Despite that, you can still do a few things before studying that ensure you don’t get distracted.
1. Leave Your Phone in Another Room I know, I know. This basically counts as blasphemy for our generation, doesn’t it? Unfortunately, and I know nobody wants to hear it, but your phone poses a huge distraction. Especially because of social media. So, unless you want to delete all your apps, including your gallery because you will find ways to distract yourself with pictures, I highly suggest leaving your phone in another room. Let your friends and family know they can’t get in touch with you and just walk away. It won’t be so bad. Think of all the social media time you’ll earn after a good night’s studying.

2. Organize a Study Session With Your Friends Some people work better in pairs or even groups. If you count yourself as one of those people, then set up some kind of study session with your friends or classmates. You can all help each other with the difficult chapters or just keep each other company! It hardly matters, since some people just focus better when they sit with other people also focusing on their work. Like reading marathons, you know? Immersing yourself in work comes easier when everyone else works, too.

3. Make Yourself a Cup of Coffee or Tea Absolutely a must. Don’t forget this crucial step, as it will guide you throughout your study session. If you feel stressed, tea helps calm your nerves while you focus on your chapters. If you start to doze off, as most do when reading postcolonial texts, then a cup of coffee should wake you right up. It also helps set the mood for a quiet study night, so that even the ambience supports your exam preparations. Win-win!

4. Decide On a Study Playlist: No Lyrics! Didn’t I just say something about ambience? You definitely need music to help focus. As someone with ADHD, I can verify that sometimes you need other noise or voices going in the background to help anchor your thoughts to the task in front of you. For that reason, many people prefer to study in cafés or libraries— the faint music or clanking teacups on saucers makes all the difference. You don’t need to play music either. There exist plenty of ambience videos on YouTube of pens on paper, hooting owls at night and a bunch of other ambience videos that really help steady your thoughts.

5. Plan Your Study Schedule Ahead of Time This one seems obvious, but no less important. Know what you want to study ahead of time. So important. If you sit down to study with no idea where to start, you will feel lost and overwhelmed, and before you know it, hours will pass by as you try to organize your schedule. You don’t always need to bind your study time to an exact chapter, but get an idea of what subject to start with. Keep a minimum chapter count to reach so that you end the day or night feeling productive and invigorated to study again the next day.

See? Studying doesn’t always need to come in these strict schedules. It might amaze you how small things in our daily life can actually distract us and make simple tasks seem impossible. With just a few minor adjustments, you can start preparing for finals with some confidence and a sound plan to make good use of your time. Like I said earlier, these changes might seem minor, but once you implement them, you get used to a new studying routine that I firmly believe can help you do your absolute best in your upcoming exams.",Pengalaman Pribadi
53,A Guide to Double-Majoring,5/10/2023,Luke Sherrill,https://www.collegemagazine.com/a-guide-to-double-majoring/,"When you first get to college, you will likely find yourself overwhelmed when meeting with your counselor for the first time and seeing the staggering number of credits lined up that you will need to take. Core electives, advanced electives, seminars and writing requirements all get thrown in your face like standing in a hailstorm. However, as I’ve accumulated more time in college, I realized I should’ve considered those freshmen requirements fluff. It gets more stressful when you declare your major. Originally, I pursued a Psychology major with a business minor. Towards the end of my sophomore year, I made the fearless decision to double major in Journalism. By the time summer came around I experienced doubts It seemed like I already had so many classes to take as a psychology major. Now I have another fat 20 credits standing in between me and my cap and gown. However, I developed a strategy to make my double major and 24 credit minor less of a stress bomb.

Below you’ll find some tactics that I like to use when balancing my double major:
What You’ll be Doing When you decide to double major, you will have twice the responsibilities in comparison to your many of your college peers. You must understand what courses you need to take to in order to graduate. By organizing and mapping out your studies, you shouldn’t have too much to worry about.

Speak to Your Advisor At most colleges you must speak to your advisor twice a year in both semesters before you can enroll in registration. Many students fail to realize their advisor is always available for an appointment. Those twice a year checks aren’t just for celebrity appearances. If you feel you may need to withdraw from a class, talk to your advisor. If you dislike your major and want to switch it, talk to your advisor. If you have a hard time balancing a full semester load while working full-time or part-time, talk to your advisor. Your advisor gets paid by your university to make these academic nightmares that keep you up at night bearable.

Keep a Checklist Handy A checklist is the best and most obvious way to keep track of valuable information. Make sure you keep a list of all the classes you have taken and the classes you need to take to graduate. Make sure you use a notebook, a word document or a spreadsheet. Use whatever method works best for you. I recommend having some type of documentation that tells you where you currently stand in college. You will feel a lot less stress about knowing when your graduation occurs.

The Classes You’ll Take You will take a mixture of Major A and Major B requirements when you double major. Keep track of both majors to make sure you don’t fall behind in one discipline or another. When breaking down your schedule, you will need to take both core classes and electives. Your college requires certain core classes that you need to take in order to graduate. You will need to take certain electives, however typically students have more options when it comes to the classes required for an elective credit. Because you have more liberty to choose an elective course make sure that subject interests you. 

Keep a Steady Balance of What Courses You Take I recommend switching up your major courses every semester. If you only take a semester worth of classes in one specific major, you will burn out. I like to keep a balance between my classes. For example, I am taking two psych courses and three journalism courses. This balance helps me because when I get tired of doing my homework for psychology, I can switch and complete some reporting for my journalism. Some people like to do all their classes for one major on a specific day and the other major on another. I am one of those people. I like to take my journalism classes on Mondays and Wednesdays and my psychology classes on Tuesdays and Thursday. This helps me stay locked and loaded with one specific major one day at a time.

We need variety as human beings. If you take four courses in the same major, you will burn out and then resent that major just from the principle of being overworked. Taking four journalism courses in one semester would make me an essay zombie. Taking four psychology courses in one semester would make me a Quizlet zombie. Taking a semester full of courses for one major will quickly lead to burnout.

To balance both of your majors, mix courses from each for a healthy blend to avoid any burnout. If you only Major A courses in a semester, your Major B knowledge will not remain fresh. The goal of a double major is to build upon each major by having them both co-align. Not only will you get more out of this method, you also won’t grow tired of one subject. You shouldn’t prosper in one major at the cost of leaving the other major in the dust. Build each major skills upon each other.

Push Yourself With Summer and January Courses Sometimes you may need to withdrawal from a course, but you don’t want to fall behind. Other times you may just want to get a head start on graduation. A great solution to both these problems is to take a class that your school offers in the summer or in January. This is a wonderful way to slip in a credit you need so that you do not fall behind.

Beware of stacking your summer courses on top of each other. Summer courses take only a fraction of the time of a semester-long course with a faster-pace. I would only advise taking multiple summer courses if you do not have any other summer commitments and if you can stay focused on your courses during those weeks. I did two courses while trying to manage an internship last summer and I would not recommend it. Summer courses are great, but remain cautious of loading up on too many up courses in your shopping cart.

Internship Prep Your skill set becomes pushed when you become a double major. A double major gets fantastic opportunities as a more well-rounded and versatile candidate for internships. When internship season comes around, I am not just be boxed into psychology or journalism internships. However, this can overwhelm anyone trying to figure out what direction they want to go in. 

Keep Track of What You Apply for I applied to nearly 30 different internships for this summer. I knew I needed to keep documentation with so many to keep track of. It works best for me to make a Google Doc and organizing a list of all completed applications as well as hyperlinking any sort of application status login. If I got rejected from that internship, I’d cross it out on that document. I also made sure to keep track of all internships with approaching deadlines on that same document. Organization is a key skill to have not only to just succeed in life, but to also not get overwhelmed and stressed.

Make your double major known to your Interviewers Interviewers find a double major impressive. It proves willingness to conquer twice the amount of course load and create an utilitarian skill set for yourself. If your interviewers ask you about your double major, take pride in it. Tell him or her how important this double major is, how you benefited from it and the work you put into completing this double major.

Reviews “To effectively get the most out of my double major I take my journalism classes and sociology classes on the same day. Monday and Wednesday I reserve for journalism and on Tuesday and Thursdays, I take my sociology classes so it’s a good balance. I would make sure your majors are complementary— if you’re passionate about STEM, make sure it’s something you can promote well,” New York University Junior Sallimatou Diaby said.

“I am a double major it is a great way to focus on my main passionate major (journalism) while getting skills out of my secondary major (environmental science). My advice for those double majoring is to make sure it’s something you really want to do,” New York University Junior Alex Tey said.

“I think my journalism major works well with double majoring. It gives me space to explore other things— and my other major supplements my journalism major so it works really well. I think it’s important to pick two majors that complement each other. That is why I am double majoring in Journalism and Politics. I try to plan my semester to where half of my courses are politics and half journalism to avoid burnout,” New York University Sophomore Carmo Moniz said.",Pengalaman Pribadi
54,I Graduated College and Felt Nothing,5/9/2023,Noor Zayter,https://www.collegemagazine.com/i-graduated-college-and-felt-nothing/,"Got you graduation coming up this year? Well, I imagine you feel a certain excitement alongside your anxiety. I bet you feel like this huge weight will fall off your shoulders with the last of your classes. Sorry to say, most people don’t end up feeling this way at all. I know I didn’t. If anything, I handed in my last essay with an uncertain feeling, like I was forgetting something important.

In other words, I finished the last of my classes and felt like I didn’t really finish at all. College always feels like a marathon, doesn’t it? We spend so much time and energy on it that when it ends, it doesn’t feel quite over. Part of this might come back to the fact that it makes up the transformative period of our lives. We move from adolescence to adulthood within our college years. So in a way, our classes and the people we meet through our lectures and clubs become a fixed part of our identities even after we leave. They helped turn us into different people, and because of that, we feel more of a difficulty letting go when the time comes. In fact, I might owe my inability to process my graduation to that fact alone.

When my last semester came, I didn’t worry or think so much about the concept of finishing college. I didn’t sit around and imagine what my graduation party would look like or what came next. I found myself, instead, swept up in the technicalities. Essay deadlines, study schedules, and actually making sure that I completed all of my required classes. People mentioned the graduation ceremony in passing, they mentioned buying caps and gowns and what the ceremony might look like.

As far as I remember, however, the finals of our last quarter carried the same leash as all our other finals. Exams remained exams. We all felt more concerned with getting through them before we could even contemplate parties and ceremonies; for the most part, the focus remained on actually finishing with our souls intact. I can say that, personally, studying and applying for my degree took the very life out of me. After I handed in my last exam ever, I felt drained. I couldn’t imagine what I would eat for dinner that night, let alone process such a hitch in my day-to-day routine.

An Interview with ASU Tempe’s Student Body President
To be honest, I didn’t even attend my ceremony. I held no interest in it at all, and I think that came down to two reasons. The first: I worried far too much about acing my exams, making sure I applied for my degree and diploma and ensuring that I remained on top of all the assignments that I needed to hand in. The second: I think a part of me just couldn’t imagine finishing such a large part of my life. I think we all leave high school with more of a finality than leaving college. Think about it. Leaving high school means leaving our teenage years. Off to independence and truly discovering our identities for the first time.

College, however, doesn’t work that way. We start adulthood with college, but we don’t leave it with our last classes and essays. I don’t think closure or endings exist with college like they do with high school. Instead, college feels more like a starting point from which we (hopefully) move forward and never stop learning. So no, I couldn’t process graduating college. Not only because my classes ended with no fanfare, no parties and no epic ceremonies to see me off, but because college always felt like more than just lectures and seminars.

Of course now, I look back on that time and I can’t help but feel some remorse. I certainly couldn’t be the only student that worried about graduating, and yet others attended the graduation ceremony. Others enjoyed celebrating with their friends or family. I, on the other hand, just wanted to finish. Looking back, I feel like I wasted my college experience because even until the very end, I looked at it as nothing but a series of classes.

So I guess what I want to say here comes down to this. You might feel the same way after you hand in that last essay or exam, like you can’t process actually being done. However, push past it, at least long enough to celebrate. Go to your graduation ceremony no matter how tired you are from studying so hard for so long. Plan an outing with your friends to say goodbye. Schedule time to reward yourself for your efforts. Maybe processing graduation for you ends up feeling as difficult as it did for me, but if I learned anything, it’s that college, if only for the amount of time and energy we spent there, signifies a phase of our lives. It deserves a proper farewell.",Pengalaman Pribadi
55,How Graduation is Causing Me a (Good) Existential Crisis,5/10/2023,Naomi Lopez,https://www.collegemagazine.com/how-graduation-is-causing-me-a-good-existential-crisis/,"“What are your post-grad plans?” “Are you excited to graduate?” “You’re going to be a real adult in the real world soon!” If you’re graduating soon, there’s no doubt you’re bombarded by these questions on an uncomfortably regular basis. Perhaps (like most of my STEM friends) you’ve already got a job lined up— you’re set, you’re good to go. Or maybe you’re more like me, in a state of “I’m not sure exactly what I want to do yet.” Regardless of whether or not we know what our future looks like, we will all be graduating and leaving college behind forever. To some, this might sound like a dream come true. To others, though, facing the reality of moving on from the lives we established and lived for years is crippling. I fall more into the latter group, as I’m a particularly nostalgic person who’s loved her college experience. Coupled with the fact that I’m prone to semi-frequent existential crises under normal circumstances, the idea of graduating has certainly made me spiral.

Graduation around the corner means that I’ve been doing a lot more of what I call time traveling. Not the typical sci-fi, Back-to-the-Future sort of time traveling, of course. I’ll often find myself wandering off in thought, thinking about a specific time period so deeply that I feel as though I’m transported back into the exact moment again. It’s usually evoked by very particular things— a certain floral scent that reminds me of my days as a dog-walker, strolling through the quiet, nature-y neighborhoods of Westwood during the spring, or a certain song that reminds me of hot summer days driving along PCH to the beach with the windows down. Being presented with an event as grandiose as college graduation adds an entirely new dimension to time travel.

This recent time travel to the past has allowed me to appreciate the personal growth I’ve made over the past four years at UCLA. For instance, just the other day, I attended the first lecture of the quarter for the class that I’ve tutored for the past two years. I walked into the quiet room a few minutes early carrying my Spikeball net, as I was going to play later with friends. After a few minutes chatting with the professor and explaining the game of roundnet (he looked perplexed when I first arrived), I took a seat in the front row. When the class started, the professor introduced us tutors before continuing on with the lecture.

It sounds like a pretty ordinary moment, but four years ago I would have never predicted it. Four years ago, I entered the same lecture hall to take my very first philosophy course. Like most of us during our first classes at college, I was nervous— when I walked in, when I picked a seat, when I thought about how I compared to my peers academically. Every lecture, I frantically typed out every word the professor said because I had no idea what I was doing. I distinctly remember seeing my TAs— walking confidently into each class and taking their designated seats in the front row— and looking on with admiration at how composed and capable they seemed. 

Now I’ve come to embody the sort of person I once looked up to. I’m much more sure of myself as a person— a natural result of the passage of time. I can feel it in the way I carry myself, walking and speaking confidently. I can feel it in the way I don’t fret about how I look or act in a crowd. Most of all, I can feel it in the way I just feel calm. Although we all know that the silly things our insecure selves worry about (like the opinions of others) truly do not matter, it’s a completely different thing to feel it for yourself.  

Beyond that, I’m much more confident in regard to academics. I know that philosophy is what I’m meant to be studying because I’ve found that it is my passion. I am unaffected by how I fare intelligently against my peers. I work hard at everything I do, and for that I can always be proud of myself. All that matters is that I’m learning and putting my best foot forward always.

Time travel back to the past brings a lot of positive feelings. Though it is easy to think about the past with a critical perspective and cringe at our past selves (so young, so naïve), I’ve learned that doing so does no good. For it is precisely these periods of self-development that are essential for our becoming who we are now. It’s a wonderful thing to take a step back, be proud of the growth you’ve made and appreciate all the events on the winding path that has placed you here today— on the verge of graduating college.

Besides looking back on the past and feeling nostalgic and grateful, I’ll also catch myself time traveling forwards. This is where I begin to lose it. I oftentimes feel very aware that the activities that I do now in my day-to-day life are the exact activities I will look back on one day in the future only as a distant, fond memory. The present I am living now is in some sense just a period of time I will look back on the way I currently look back on the past.

This reality is what I struggle to come to terms with. Precisely because I enjoy my life the way it is right now and spend my time doing the things I love with the people I love, the knowledge that it’s going to be forever changed soon makes my heart sink. I’m not afraid of change— change is always inevitable. Rather, I find myself frozen by the sort of future nostalgia I feel in knowing that these are the days I will miss so dearly. The fact of the matter has always remained the same— we are going to graduate, and these lives we once knew will be a thing of the past— but my emotional stance toward this fact is what I had difficulty changing.

By simply sitting through these uncomfortable, existential feelings (rather than avoiding them), I’ve come to feel much more at peace with the notion of graduating and leaving my life at UCLA behind. The passage of time is, of course, a natural phenomenon— it moves on whether or not we want it to. All we can do is appreciate each moment for what it is and accept the bittersweet knowledge that it will pass. There’s a French word I often think about called des vú— the knowledge that this moment will become a memory. Before, I would crumble at this truth; but now, it simply allows me to feel gratitude for each moment of each day— talking with friends, going to sports games, even just walking to class.

What I’ve learned in allowing my once bleak thoughts to swirl around my mind is that existential crises about graduation don’t have to be a negative thing. Though a lot of us love our lives right now and will miss them dearly, it is a reality we must face. That doesn’t mean it has to be a reality that cripples us. Taking time to reflect on the growth we’ve made between our past and present selves should allow us to feel excited for what’s to come. We should feel only optimistic about the growth and experiences our future selves will have.",Pengalaman Pribadi
56,So I Moved Back Home After Graduation…,5/5/2023,Heather Kierzek,https://www.collegemagazine.com/so-i-moved-back-home-after-graduation/,"Imagine going the experience of living in a huge city. You don’t need to use your car. Reliable public transportation exists and you can walk around safely. Anything you can imagine is at your fingertips. The hustle and bustle don’t worry you anymore and you just can live. Then imagine yourself being transported to the middle of nowhere where all of those things don’t exist. I know I’m exaggerating, but I had that exact experience. It took a lot for my hatred to turn to toleration. 

I know I am not the first to say this, but I hate my hometown. My parents moved me from New Jersey down to Florida and everyone always told me that I should love it down here. People always gush about the warm weather year-round. I appreciate certain aspects of it, such as the wonderful beaches and the beautiful afternoon summer storms. Unfortunately, not many retirees down here understand my love for the changing seasons and to actually experience snow in the winter. Part of me feels like my parents took that experience from me, though I know they wanted to not have to worry about plowing the driveway every winter. On top of that, they decided to settle in a small town far away from anything that normal teenagers might consider fun. The nicer beaches are at least a two-hour drive away, as well as any cities such as Tampa or Orlando. 

Needless to say, the lack of activities and the brutal summer heat made me hate my hometown more the older I got. You can only drive to Target and wander through the aisles so many times before you get tired of it. 

That drove me to leave Florida for college. Deciding I most likely wouldn’t appreciate the intensity of New York City, I settled in Washington D.C. Let me tell you, that change of scenery and the walkability of the city made my wildest dreams come true. Nothing could truly describe the joy living there for a few years made me feel. I tried multiple different cuisines from multiple different cultures. I met so many incredible people, forming wonderful bonds with them that I know I will keep for the rest of my life. I lived within walking distance of many of the national monuments and museums. The overload of activities kept me happy and busy. 

Fairy tales don’t last forever and neither did my time in Washington D.C.
Graduation crept up on me faster than I imagined it would. Before I knew it, I had to leave the place that I considered my new home. On top of that, I ended up moving back home. My mother grew ill my final semester of my senior year and unfortunately passed. That left both my brother and I with responsibilities in our childhood home that neither of us expected. I planned on transferring to get my master’s degree after graduation anyway, so I settled for the one online program I applied for. I knew the program suited me well, and it would help me handle some of the responsibilities left for me. So, I moved back home. 

In my first month home, I reconnected with my few friends from high school and did my best to make the most out of this situation. I had been away for such a long time at that point that doing so really helped me enjoy that one month. But the more that time passed, the more I began to find myself giving into the familiar loathing that my hometown made me feel. I had two options. I could either give into it entirely and rip apart everything that annoyed me in the slightest or I could try to turn my attitude towards appreciation. I chose the latter option. 

Finding things to appreciate ended up a much harder task than originally anticipated.
I told myself to point out one thing each day that I enjoyed about where I lived. I tried to do this a lot whenever I drove to work. Sometimes I would see cute cows grazing in the fields, only to scowl at the realization that I had to actually drive somewhere instead of walking like I used to. That paired with “I Know The End” by Phoebe Bridgers spiraled me back into the same negative thought process. Every time that I found myself with that type of thought surrounding my current situation, I forced myself to stop and think as to why I thought that way. Finding the root of this hatred helped me dismantle my negative feelings bit by bit. I don’t like admitting it, but the negative thoughts were very irrational. I compare them to a child having a temper tantrum. I am still quite embarrassed by them, even if no one can peek into my mind to see them. 

I worked hard to give myself things to look forward to. I treated myself to my favorite coffee drink every Friday on my way to my part-time job, which helped me gain a bit of excitement towards the end of the week. I scheduled extra time to hang out with my childhood best friend that I hadn’t seen much since I went to Washington D.C. I settled into a routine that involved nature walks and seeing the scenery that I hadn’t in ages.

The more that I found little things to enjoy, the more that my hatred for my hometown disappeared. I realized that I wouldn’t stay here a long time ago, but after everything that happened with my mom, my responsibilities kept me here. I think that began the downward spiral of negativity that I felt. I was my biggest enemy, not my hometown. I never thought I would feel the appreciation I feel now. I still don’t like living here, but living here now doesn’t feel unbearable. This phase of my life will pass eventually and life is too short to continuously have negativity surrounding you. If you find yourself in my shoes, know that you can leave eventually. But if you find yourself stuck in one spot for too long, try finding little things that bring you joy. You never know just how happy it can make you feel.",Pengalaman Pribadi
57,How I Managed to Study on Spring Break,4/25/2023,Luke Sherrill,https://www.collegemagazine.com/how-i-managed-to-study-on-spring-break/,"Spring Break is time of relaxation from your everyday stresses of academia. However, sometimes your schedule nightmares become reality. In my case, this meant having to study for midterms that started right after my spring break. I originally planned to go to the beach with two of my friends, but my midterm schedule turned into a big conflict of interest. I realized I could have best of both worlds. I just needed to remain organized and committed in completing my work.

Here are some key takeaways that allowed me to balance out my academic requirements with some much deserved breaktime.  
Plan Everything Out Whether you go to Cabo, Colorado or California— you’ll likely have a full itinerary planned out. For me personally, our plans were very chill. This included going to the beach in the afternoon, hanging out with a few beers and watching the sunset. Because of all the downtime, I planned when I wanted to get my work done. The morning would be used for dedicating at least one hour, if not more to studying before my friends woke up. I would then enjoy the rest of my day. Before dinner I would try to carve out an extra block of time to get work done. By establishing a routine, getting my work done became easier. 

Your Spring Break isn’t for your Professor’s Consider office hours a secret hack in terms of understanding the concepts brought up in your class as clearly as possible. However, you’d surprised to understand that most of your professors don’t take a week off during spring break. Their accessibility remains open via email or zoom. If you stress yourself out when studying over Spring Break, shoot your professor an email and work with them during online office hours to really understand the material. In one of my classes, the professor assigned a paper due in two weeks. Still confused by the direction I wanted to take, I decided to go to office hours. One quick zoom call with my professor clarified all of my confusion and made my work so much easier.  

Stay Sober  As much of a no-brainer this one might seem, make this advice crucial to your studies. Intoxication impairs your studying performance and a bunch of research can prove this. According to the multiple papers, alcohol can impair memory only after a few drinks and creates negative acute learning effects. I can safely say that when I wanted to kick it with my friends and have a drink or two, I made sure to complete all my work for the day. Treat that drink as a reward to motivate you to get your work done!  

During my first few days of Spring Break, I refused to check my emails. This turned into a terrible mistake! That first Monday of my spring break overwhelmed me looking at an inbox filled to the brim with multiple unread emails, some of academic concern and others of internship obligations. I realized that I needed to check them every day to further avoid this and so I did. Not only will you find this approach less overwhelming, but this tactic will make all your future jobs easier. Being on break doesn’t mean you should be impossible to reach.

Last But Not Least, Enjoy Yourself  Believe it or not, this mantra ended up as the easiest for me to forget. At times during my break, I would get so caught up in my work that I would look at my clock and realize how much time went by. The purpose of Spring Break is to give students a release and pause from the stress that can accumulate during the school year. I’m not going to get another spring break for full year, so why waste it? Halfway through my week, I realized I worked too hard on an assignment with a far off due date. I realized I didn’t need to work myself to the bone as long as I kept a good balance. I planned out everything more efficiently and took a breather to enjoy the sunshine, the beach and the company of my friends. Out of everything on the list, many overlook this one entirely. That’s why I decided to reroute my focus on enjoying my spring break.

58,10 Tips on Making Lasting Friendships in the Classroom,3/10/2023,Devin Stonerock,https://www.collegemagazine.com/10-tips-making-lasting-friendships-classroom/,"Here we go again (or, for some of you, the first time). A new semester begins, and you rush to your new classes. Everyone files in and gets ready for an hour’s worth of note taking. A few students happily recognize each other, but not many. Everyone else sits down by themselves and prepares for class to start. Unfortunately, you belong to the latter group. But don’t start to worry yet. This situation doesn’t need to last for long.

Just follow this list of 10 easy tips to help you make new friends in class. And the best part? We even give tips on how to keep these friends, even when the semester eventually ends.
1. Stay Aware of Your Surroundings
Most of us can probably plead guilty to this: we take our seats and instantly take out our phones. How can you expect to meet new people if you choose to socialize with the ones you already know? Try looking around you instead. You never know who you may have missed walking in the door after you.

“I always make new friends because I recognize my friends’ friends,” Duke University junior Ethan Holmes said.

Frat parties, dorm rooms, the dining hall. Imagine the possibilities. Give it a try. Like Eli, you could strike up a conversation with a potential friend simply because you share a common friend and didn’t even realize it.

2. Don’t Confine Yourself to Only One Potential Friend You want to not only make new friends in class but real friendships that continue when the semester ends. Anyone can be a class friend. You sit next to each other, add each other on social media and occasionally help each other out with classwork. Class ends, and POOF! you never talk again. In order to avoid this unfortunate event, try to socialize with more than just one classmate. I know this may seem difficult as most of us tend to pick one person and cling to them for dear life, hoping they are “the one.” But try to avoid this mistake. I suggest talking to several people sitting around you rather than that one person you initially singled out. Maybe they didn’t seem like your “type” at first glance, but make an effort to strike up a conversation. You can’t get to know someone if you don’t talk to them. The more potential class friends you make, the more potential real friends you make.

3. Be Open and Hand Out Compliments If something confuses you, don’t hesitate to ask your new friend. Opening yourself up this way shows vulnerability. It makes others feel at ease knowing that you trust their judgment. And once they know that you experience similar insecurities (because we all do), they know they can start to let their guard down too. Since we all experience vulnerability every once in a while, it makes us feel better about ourselves when others point out our strengths. I think everyone appreciates a good compliment once in a while. An “I like your hair” or “That’s a cool drawing” every so often can go a long way.

4. Take Advantage of Group Work and Study Groups
Group work happens both inside and outside of the classroom. During group work, people tend to open up and talk a bit more (about something other than the geology class you currently attend). In these gatherings, people’s personalities begin to shine.

“Class friends became friends by doing study groups and meeting once a week to catch up on homework. And then personalities develop from that,” South University, Florida alumni Jess Alper said.

As personalities develop, people will begin to talk more about their interests and hobbies. Here you can expect shared interests to pop up. Finding a common interest helps jumpstart communication for a friendship with the possibility of lasting beyond the classroom.

5. Make Conversation in the Hall Before or After Class Do you notice that your behavior and attitude change the second you walk into the classroom? I think most students do that. Most of us start learning the appropriate volume of our voice in preschool. So naturally, you walk into a classroom, and you can hear a pin drop. However, before everyone files in or once everyone files out that door, our perception of the appropriate way to act differs from in the classroom. People tend to let their guard down and feel more relaxed. This gives you the perfect time to exchange numbers.

6. Be Bold I cannot stress the importance of confidence enough. I know. The idea of walking up to someone and asking for their number seems terrifying. But would it surprise you to know that a majority of students get excited when that happens? Most people look forward to seeing a friendly face in class each day.

“You have to be confident. You have to walk up to someone smiling, being like ‘I would really like your number so we could help each other out.’ With a smile and confidence, everyone is drawn towards you,” Purdue University graduate Lauren Widel said. It doesn’t mean your fear of rejection cannot exist. But there’s no harm in making the first move. Someone needs to do it. Why not you? (I show an example of my own in the last tip).

7. Text Them About Things Other Than Schoolwork As of now, your friendship exists due to your shared interest in (let’s continue with my example above) geology. Maybe you do, in fact, share a strong fondness for rocks beyond the classroom, but that scenario won’t play out in most cases. I, by no means, advise that you avoid class topics altogether. But occasionally, throw in an ‘I can’t wait to finish this homework so I can watch  this movie tonight” or “OMG, I need a coffee break!” Texts like these may help to open the conversation to something other than class. Oh, and make sure you only text them and not the class group chat that includes the professor. (You may want him to think you really do love rocks.)

8. Start Small Don’t make your first meeting outside the class together a big outing. For example, I don’t suggest inviting them to lunch with your family, who came to visit you from out of state. Maybe start with a short coffee break between classes.

“We started studying together and meeting off-campus… After our first semester exams, we went to lunch and got pedicures. Over winter break, we still communicated. [We] decided that we should meet up and bake Christmas cookies,” Indiana University graduate Meaghan Chinn said. “We turned that into an annual event. We introduced our kids to each other and their spouses. We went through major life events together during school, like marriage and having kids.”

If you plan your first outing as a big engagement, you can probably expect to scare your potential new friend away. In Meaghan’s case, she simply began to study off campus. This built up to lunch and pedicures and eventually experiencing life events. Could you imagine your response if someone you barely knew invited you to their wedding?

9. Put Effort into Supporting Your New Friend in Something Other Than Academics After following these tips, you probably spend more time texting about things you find interesting rather than classwork. It’s likely you’ve moved up to hanging out more often than the occasional coffee date. Seeing as you met in class, they already know you support them academically. But a true friend supports you through other things.

“They [the friends she made in class] would even come to support me as I participated in track meets, and I supported them in their sport,” Anderson University graduate Jennifer Moon said.

Attending each others sports games serves as one way show support your new friends. However, you can support them in plenty of other ways. For example, join them in their favorite club once in a while. Maybe you don’t share the same love of rocks that they do, but you can sit through the geology club for an hour. In showing them you support them in other ways outside of class, the more likely the friendship will last.

10. Don’t Stress I know that these tips may seem like a lot reading them all at once but don’t get overwhelmed just yet. I know for certain that these tips work. I remember sitting in my freshmen psych 101 lecture all alone, wishing for a friend. Feeling courageous, I sent this email to a good friend who I graduated with from Indiana Wesleyan University online, which ignited our friendship. “Hi Corie, I took my last class with Michelle, and she mentioned you (Stay Aware of Your Surroundings). This class makes no sense, and from your discussion posts, you seem intelligent (Be Open and Hand Out Compliments), and I am in need of a new study buddy. Here is my number. You should text me (Be Bold).” Three tips in a single email, and it worked. Easy peasy! Follow these tips, and don’t stress out too much.",Pengalaman Pribadi
59,What's Your Major?,3/7/2023,Naomi Lopez,https://www.collegemagazine.com/picking-college-major/,"The inevitable question college students hear all the time— and if you’re not in college yet, prepare yourself. From nosy relatives to fellow college students looking to make friends, this is the go-to inquiry. It’s a valid question, but it still may stress some of us out, especially if we have no clue what we want to study.

If you know exactly what you want to pursue and you’re passionate about it, more power to you. 
I was one of the lost ones. I always loved my English classes in high school. Essay-writing, spelling tests, reading (I know some of you are recoiling as you read this, but yes, reading)— I enjoyed all of it. I excelled at math and science too, but I never felt the same passion towards my STEM classes.

Despite my interest in English, I applied to UCLA as “undeclared.” I knew there was a variety of subjects outside the high school curriculum I didn’t even know existed, and I wanted to keep my options open before settling on one thing. 

But I didn’t like how “undeclared” sounded. It made me feel as though I was lost— a puppy amongst a pack of dogs who knew exactly what they wanted to do. Whenever someone in class or on my dorm floor asked what my major was, I felt myself getting anxious. Why do I feel so badly about not having it figured out? I asked myself. 

Fast forward a few months through my freshman year. I took several GE classes to expose myself to new subjects and figure out what piqued my interest. And unexpectedly, along came one that changed the trajectory of my life (dramatic, but true).

Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind. Probably as niche philosophy as you can get. “What is consciousness?” was the big question we tackled. I found myself completely fascinated by the material. Puzzling my way through readings, I genuinely felt excited to go to class each day. It wasn’t easy by any means— I remember once attending office hours for help on content I pulled an all-nighter trying to wrap my mind around. But I had never been so intrigued. 

I felt like I had finally found my thing. The thing that invited me to push the limits of my own potential, to think in ways I never had before about things I never had before, but most importantly I had found what I was passionate about. 

So philosophy it was. I picked up my minor in environmental systems and society during my second year, having realized I wanted to learn more about how I could live my life in an environmentally friendly way. I added my minor in professional writing later, which allowed me to maintain my passion for writing.

I no longer felt the embarrassment that came when telling people I was “still figuring out what I wanted to do.” I found a way to learn about all of the subjects I cared about. This has made my academic experience of college the one I always hoped to have. 

Unfortunately, I don’t think my experience is the norm. Over time I realized that societal standards were to blame for my uneasiness. In today’s world it is expected that students have their plans figured out— what they want to study or what career they want. This societal (and sometimes parental) pressure leads us to perceive this sort of uncertainty as inherently “bad.” Students then sometimes come to rushed decisions about their futures. But oftentimes, these choices are based on what they feel they should do, not what they want to do. 

I know several people who hate what they study but stick with it because a job in that field pays well or because it’s what their parents wanted them to do. I recognize that each individual has different goals, financial situations and privileges in these sorts of life decisions. The people I know in this boat are all fortunate enough (like myself) to have the freedom to follow their passions, but typically don’t. 

As students and more importantly as human beings navigating our personal lives, our best solution to these imposed standards is to be patient, explore our options and discover what is meant for us. I chose to be patient and allowed my passions to find me, and I encourage others to do the same. Because it has the power to make your college experience uniquely yours. ",Pengalaman Pribadi
60,The Teacher I Hated Changed my College Journey,2/21/2023,John Shay,https://www.collegemagazine.com/teacher-i-hated-changed-college-journey/,"As a high schooler, I felt lost in my future. I felt unsure about what I wanted to major in at college. Up to that point, no academic subjects particularly interested me. I hoped for at least an idea of what I wanted to do in the future. Before I knew it, applying for colleges would be around the corner.

Later that year, I discovered my love for journalism, specifically telling peoples’ stories. I knew I wanted to major in journalism. However, the way I ended up there was completely unexpected. During my freshman year of high school, I took a biology class. Whether my dislike of science got in the way or my teacher actually didn’t like me, I never liked biology class or my teacher. I dreaded going to the class and could not wait to get away from her at the end of the year. Little did I know this wouldn’t be my last time dealing with her.

During this time, I wrote for our school newspaper. Periodically, we produced hard copies of our paper and handed them out to students before school. For my sophomore year’s hard copy, my editor tasked me with writing a feature article on a science teacher who fled the war-torn country of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a child. The article sounded exciting until I realized the subject of the article would be none other than my freshman year biology teacher. My journalism sponsor probably noticed the look on my face after assigning the article to me because he came over a couple of minutes later to ask what was wrong with the article assignment. I told him that this teacher taught me in my freshman year bio class and that I did not get along with her. He offered to switch my article assignment, but I told him there would not be a problem and I would write the article.

I emailed her and set up an interview for the next day after school. The whole day, I dreaded the interview, but 3:05 p.m. finally hit, and I went down to her room to begin the interview. I sat down across from her desk with a set of questions ready at my hand.

While I walked into the interview just hoping I would get out of there with a couple of good quotes, what happened next took me by complete surprise.
I sat with her for over an hour, and after my first question, I completely abandoned the list I came in with. Every follow-up question came to me naturally. This was the first time I conducted an interview that felt less like a coordinated question-and-answer session and more like a free flowing conversation. I never heard a more interesting story. This biology teacher, whom I desired to get away from and dreaded interviewing, changed the way I look at journalism. I realized that the power lay with me to tell stories that people likely would never hear otherwise. I could tell hundreds of students this teacher’s story and let them share the same level of intrigue I felt when interviewing her.

That night, I went home and wrote the article, having it ready for my editor the next day. This article changed a lot for me. It helped me achieve the editor position on the paper for my junior and senior years of high school. More importantly, it helped me realize that I wanted to major in journalism. Sharing her story ignited my passion for writing and for telling the stories of voices seldom heard.",Pengalaman Pribadi
61,Avoid College Application Regrets: Tips For Getting It Right the First Time,4/28/2023,Sam Jaquez,https://www.collegeconfidential.com/articles/college-application-regrets/,"Decision Day occurs each year on May 1st and is the deadline for students to inform the college of their choice of their intent to attend through submitting an enrollment deposit.

As decision day approaches, many students are considering their offers of admission and preparing to make their final decision on where they will be attending college in the fall. In reflection of the application process, College Confidential posted a few polls as a way to gauge how students felt about their experiences.

What would you do differently if you had to apply again?
157 students answered the first question which asked what they would do differently if they went through the application process again. These were the results:

27 percent would not do anything differently
25 percent would apply to different schools
25 percent would apply to more schools
19 percent would apply to fewer schools
4 percent would pick more safety schools to apply to
Highlighted by the 50 percent of students reflecting that they would apply to different or more schools, the importance of doing adequate research before applying to schools is one of the most crucial steps in college planning.

What’s your most surprising outcome this decision season?
For the next poll question, 133 students answered with their most surprising outcome from decision season:

26 percent received merit aid that they were not expecting
23 percent got into a very competitive school
21 percent were admitted to one of the reach schools
19 percent were rejected from one of their safety schools
7 percent received a very generous financial aid package
4 percent did not get into any of the schools they applied to
With 44 percent of students surprised that they were admitted into a very competitive school or one of their reach schools, it is clear that applying to a variety of schools can result in a positive outcome.

Tips for Applying to College
When asked to elaborate on their experience with applying, preparing, and choosing a college or university, several community members who took the polls offered tips that helped them succeed. By far, the most common piece of advice for students was to start the application and preparation process early.

Here are additional tips given by the CC community members based on their experiences this application season.

Advising
Make sure to speak with your school counselor early in the process, as they can often have great advice: “[My son] was lucky to be advised by the school counselor to apply early to all colleges that offered this option. Though we thought that was not necessary, later we found this was the most valuable advice we have ever received” –sherik
Consider seeking out help from an admissions advisor for additional guidance: “Should have hired an independent admissions advisor (even just for 2 or 3 sessions) to help through the process of applying to east coast schools, for reviewing essay, knowing what schools would offer significant financial aid.” –pnwner
Setting up a dedicated admissions process email will make it easy to stay organized and help keep your inbox from being overloaded with all of the school emails you’ll be receiving: “The number one thing I would have done differently would have been to set up a dedicated email account just for admissions. So much email. SO much.” – Mrspresidio
Essays and Testing
Start writing your college essays the summer before senior year: “had [my son] start essays early in the summer and the time and attention really paid off.” –socalmom007
Take a test prep course before testing: If you plan on submitting test scores as part of your application, taking a test prep course can help you prepare for what to expect, possibly help improve your score, and can help you know what to expect for test day.
School Tours
Create your list of prospective schools early in junior year before going on school tours: “Our college research started the summer before junior year, so we could have a list of universities to visit that met [our] needs and preferences. This meant we could visit a lot of colleges during junior year, and leave just a couple for September of senior year.” –ProfSD
Start visiting colleges during junior year: ""I want us to visit more schools early in the game, like junior year. I thought it made financial sense to wait and focus our visits on where my [daughter] was accepted . . . But with late March / April 1 acceptances, that meant an exhausting, complicated scramble to visit a bunch of schools quickly—and some we just couldn’t get to and, as a result, didn’t really consider seriously, though they might have been good options. Next time, early visits! Then we can always go back if it comes down to a short list of real options."" –Brillig
Attend virtual events hosted for prospective students
Visit a variety of campus types to find the type of campus that feels right (big, small, city, suburb, public, private, etc.): “A good idea sometime during Junior year is to go to a place like Boston where there are MANY types of schools/campuses. That way you can narrow down preferences - big/small/big sports/urban campus.” –TonyGrace
A good alternative for going on tours, if that is not possible, is to search for “day in my life” videos on social media sites: “I wish I had found small liberal arts colleges that had the vibes I wanted which is why I wish I either visited or watched day in the life videos to figure out.” – ducky22
Application Tips
Pay closer attention to application deadlines and make a calendar of important dates: “I would have worked to understand the deadlines for each of these schools. She applied to so many that she missed scholarship deadlines and was overwhelmed with so much information.” –syr2023
Consider applying early admission: ""I would recommend encouraging your kid to try ED1 and ED2 especially if they are aiming high. It doesn’t always turn out but you haven’t lost anything by trying."" –Techno13
Apply to schools that you can truly see yourself attending or you might feel limited with your choices come decision time: ""Personally, I would have applied to more schools that I could see myself at . . . I applied to a few and I got in, but I didn’t see myself being happy at all but one of them."" –ducky22
Don’t be afraid to apply to more competitive schools even if you feel like you might not have a change of acceptance: “If I could have done anything differently, I would have applied to less safeties and more competitive schools. I was admitted into schools I never could have imagined getting into” –Talulazzz
It doesn’t hurt to apply to schools that have a free application fee: “My 2023 HS grad would have applied to more colleges if he had realized most small [liberal arts colleges] have a Zero application fee.“ –CoastalGirl7
Demonstrate interest throughout the application process: “Even though she was accepted to all the schools she applied to, many schools did not offer scholarships, so learning to demonstrate an interest in those schools she loved was key.” –syr2023
Choosing Schools
Set realistic expectations when choosing potential schools
Choose a school for a focus/major/program rather than the school’s rank
Talk with current students at potential colleges: This is a good way to get a student perspective of the school and program you’re interested in that you won't get on an official tour or by talking to a representative.
Make sure that the school you choose aligns with your expectations in all aspects: “I would look more closely at the student population, it’s diversity, and where most of the students came from (distance-wise from the school). I think I focused on the strength of the school in the field I’m interested in, cost and merit awards, and activities that were on and off campus that I might enjoy well, but forgot that if there’s not much diversity in the population base of students, and I don’t fit into that base well, it makes it difficult to fit in.” –klagman",Pengalaman Pribadi
62,Why Duke University Stood Out To Me,3/22/2023,Amelia Leone,https://www.collegeconfidential.com/articles/duke-campus-tour/,"Notes From My Duke Campus Tour
At this point in my college search, I have considered several college types–big, small, city, suburban, prestigious, ‘rah rah.’ Before touring Duke University, I still had no sense of what I wanted, or rather, what aspects of a school I wanted to prioritize. As it is easy to get caught up in the minute details of a school, a friendly reminder to myself and all other college applicants: a school will rarely have every single thing you are looking for. Instead, it is important to be mindful about which characteristics are essential to your ideal college experience–whether that’s location, size, or campus culture–and which you can be flexible with.

As I strolled out of my Duke tour, I realized that I had a better grasp on my personal priorities for a college. I understood which traits of the school I particularly appreciated, felt impartial to, and wasn’t a fan of. My next step will be to apply these opinions to a broader scale of schools in order to point myself in a more beneficial and specific direction in my college search.

I came to realize that, for me, attending a medium-sized school with strong academics, ample amounts of spirit, and a large yet walkable campus was of the utmost importance.

With all that being said, below I have compiled a short description on the campus, academics, and school spirit at Duke University. First, reflect on yourself and determine your non-negotiables. Next, feel free to take a look at my description of those three aspects of Duke and see if they align!

Vibrant Campus Duke has a little under seven thousand undergraduates, plus just over ten thousand graduate and professional students. To many prospective students, however, those numbers are hard to conceptualize and merely feel like school facts. To me, the best way to describe the feel of the population would be by explaining what I saw during a weekday lunchtime on campus.

Due to the fact that the West Campus dining hall in particular is famous for its wide variety of high-quality food, it felt as though a majority of the school crowded into the central walkway during lunchtime. Though there were likely thousands of students located in and around the dining hall, several times I saw classmates bump into each other and spark friendly conversation. Additionally, many students chose to eat and converse outside at Duke’s central eating area, accurately named “The Plaza.” Here, students congregate for meals, hangouts, and in-between class chats.

The main West Campus dining hall in Broadhead Center, which is informally known as the WU (West Union), is a Time-Out Market type restaurant with thirteen individual food stalls representing every ethnic flavor you could imagine. Best part is that you get to use your dining dollars, called Blue Bucks, which are included in your food plan! When I went, I selected Indian curry, chicken tikka masala and delicious naan from a large buffet that had many meat and meatless options.

Due to the fact that I visited in January, it was extremely sunny out, which I was told was a common occurrence. It seemed as though most students simply popped on sweatshirts and joined their friends outside. Because it was lunchtime and everyone was centrally located around the WU, the Plaza was bustling but not crowded. People chatted within their circle but also often wandered about the plaza and spoke with passersby or club representatives who had set up tables. To me, the Plaza and WU felt like the heartbeat of campus. The area had lots of personality and room, both physically and socially, for everyone.

Outside of the Plaza, the campus is composed of beautiful Gothic style buildings and large expanses of bright green grass. Also, the campus is located in the middle of the forest so there are tons of trees along the perimeter.

Academics That Encourage Growth
Duke’s “Growth from exploration” motto is deeply embodied in its curriculum and was expressed all throughout the tour. Duke University is divided into two colleges–the Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering. This allows the schools to exist as both a liberal arts and research institution.

During my tour, the student leader explained how her favorite thing about the university is the fact that students can uniquely shape their journey by combining up to three avenues of study–major, minor, and certificate. Apparently 83 percent of students choose to complete some combination of these three things, which contributes to an intellectually stimulating community and prepares students for the job market.

Strong School Spirit
With Duke’s stellar Division I sports teams comes school spirit, and a lot of it! While I was there, I got to see the students “tenting,” or camping out, in front of the Duke stadium for the few weeks leading up to the highly anticipated Duke vs University of North Carolina basketball game. Though this tenting tradition occurs during only one month of the year, the passion and pride which drives it is a constant, according to students. Even when taking a short walk around campus, one will find Duke merch all over the place.

Through talk I overheard of nighttime activities, it's clear that students enjoy nights out and have vibrant social lives. However, I doesn't seem like this infringes on students’ work ethic. If anything, balancing school work and social life speaks to their ability to manage responsibilities and create a well-rounded lifestyle.

I felt that at Duke, students could truly get the best of both worlds. Between the strong academics, invigorating social life and exciting school spirit, it appears as though Duke University allows students to make a perfectly enjoyable and balanced life.

63,What Is A Good High School GPA For Top Colleges?,6/6/2022,Angela Combs,https://www.collegeconfidential.com/articles/what-is-a-good-high-school-gpa-for-top-colleges/,"Your Grade Point Average (GPA) is one of the first criteria US college admissions officers will use to determine the strength of your candidacy. At the most competitive universities, like those in the Ivy League, the average admit has a perfect GPA! It takes years to build your GPA, so it’s vital to understand its importance early in your high school career.

What is a GPA?
A high school Grade Point Average (GPA) is a score, generally on a 4-point scale, that reflects your academic performance in high school and is mostly used in the United States. While US universities don’t release official GPA criteria, they do have score expectations and may eliminate candidates with low GPAs before even looking at the rest of their application!

Since academics can account for up to 40% of your application, depending on which universities you apply to, good grades are critical — especially at the most competitive schools. And no academic component is more important than your high school GPA.

A good GPA is indicative of a dedicated, well-rounded student who can perform in a classroom environment.

Universities may track your GPA back as far as the age of 14, so it’s important to start your first year of high school with solid grades and continuously work to strengthen them. Universities also look for a steady improvement over the years and evidence that you’ve consistently worked hard to get top marks!

What is a good GPA?
The average high school GPA in the US is 3.0, which also accounts for roughly 35% of students who don’t end up applying for college.

Of college applicants, however, the average GPA is more likely between 3.5 and 4.0. If you’re aiming for a top university such as one in the Ivy League, Stanford, MIT, or others of the same caliber, a 4.0 GPA — or close to it — is expected.

However, to make things a bit more complicated, GPAs on the traditional 4.0 scale are considered ‘unweighted’ — which can be a disadvantage as it doesn’t take the difficulty of different classes into account.

For this reason, the most selective US universities prefer the ‘weighted’ GPA system, which provides a more accurate depiction of the standard achieved across a selection of students, and is measured on a 5-point scale.

Since admission rates at most selective universities tend to fall in the single-digit range and GPAs for admitted students hover around 4.0, taking more difficult classes is essential to bolster your GPA and get into universities like Harvard, Yale, or similarly competitive institutions.

What is a good GPA for Ivy League Schools and other top universities?
The academic expectations of Ivy League schools and other top universities are well above average; in fact, most Ivy League students graduate high school with a GPA above 4.0! This is because all the Ivy League universities take into account a weighted GPA over an unweighted one.

Average GPA (weighted) of Accepted Students at Top Schools How to Calculate Your GPA
A GPA converts the letters or percentages that typically represent your grades into numbers, then finds the average of those numbers. Let’s say you’re taking five classes, and you have A’s in two of them and B’s in three of them. The two A’s will each translate to 4.0, and the three B’s will each translate to 3.0. If you add 4.0 + 4.0 + 3.0 + 3.0 + 3.0 and then divide by five, you’ll get the average: a GPA of 3.4.

When applying to US universities, it's important to know how your grades line up with the university's expectations. You can use Crimson Education’s free High School GPA Calculator or refer to the GPA conversion table below to find out your GPA!

GPA Conversion Chart How can I improve my GPA?
Top universities don’t necessarily expect you to have good grades from the beginning. They want to see growth, ambition and drive. The simple answer is to do well in school and ace all your exams, but this is often difficult for some students.

For students who need a little extra help, Crimson Education offers online tutoring. Crimson engages the world’s best teachers and tutors to help students get good grades and reach their university admission goals.

Next Steps
If your sights are set on the Ivy League or any top university, challenge yourself with your course choices. Universities aren't looking for perfection — they're looking for students who challenged themselves academically and will continue to do so after high school.

For this reason, the most selective US universities prefer the ‘weighted’ GPA system, which provides a more accurate depiction of the standard achieved across a selection of students, and is measured on a 5-point scale.

Since admission rates at most selective universities tend to fall in the single-digit range and GPAs for admitted students hover around 4.0, taking more difficult classes is essential to bolster your GPA and get into universities like Harvard, Yale, or similarly competitive institutions.

What is a good GPA for Ivy League Schools and other top universities?
The academic expectations of Ivy League schools and other top universities are well above average; in fact, most Ivy League students graduate high school with a GPA above 4.0! This is because all the Ivy League universities take into account a weighted GPA over an unweighted one.

Average GPA (weighted) of Accepted Students at Top Schools How to Calculate Your GPA
A GPA converts the letters or percentages that typically represent your grades into numbers, then finds the average of those numbers. Let’s say you’re taking five classes, and you have A’s in two of them and B’s in three of them. The two A’s will each translate to 4.0, and the three B’s will each translate to 3.0. If you add 4.0 + 4.0 + 3.0 + 3.0 + 3.0 and then divide by five, you’ll get the average: a GPA of 3.4.

When applying to US universities, it's important to know how your grades line up with the university's expectations. You can use Crimson Education’s free High School GPA Calculator or refer to the GPA conversion table below to find out your GPA!

Top universities don’t necessarily expect you to have good grades from the beginning. They want to see growth, ambition and drive. The simple answer is to do well in school and ace all your exams, but this is often difficult for some students.

For students who need a little extra help, Crimson Education offers online tutoring. Crimson engages the world’s best teachers and tutors to help students get good grades and reach their university admission goals.

Next Steps
If your sights are set on the Ivy League or any top university, challenge yourself with your course choices. Universities aren't looking for perfection — they're looking for students who challenged themselves academically and will continue to do so after high school.

65,8 of the Best Liberal Arts Colleges: Webinar Recap,4/12/2023,Shreya Nagunuri,https://www.collegeconfidential.com/articles/8-of-the-best-liberal-arts-colleges/,"Each fall and spring, Admissions reps from eight highly-regarded liberal arts colleges (LACs) from around the U.S. come together to share information about their unique offerings, challenging curriculums, and stand-out locations. These schools include Claremont McKenna College, Colorado College, Connecticut College, Grinnell College, Haverford College, Kenyon College, Macalester College, and Sarah Lawrence College. Let’s break down what each school offers in a recap!

Similarities

Many liberal arts colleges are quite similar in many ways. Unlike large universities, most liberal arts schools do not offer grad programs, so they are completely focused on undergrads. For example, all classes are taught by professors instead of TA's and all the resources on campus are for undergrads. In addition, liberal arts colleges tend to be small schools with a low student-to-faculty ratio, which makes it easy for students to cultivate strong mentor connections with their professors and receive help from them. Another plus about liberal arts colleges is that they usually have residential campuses, where students can live for all four years of college. Most students at liberal arts colleges graduate within four years and study abroad.

While there are many shared characteristics for small liberal arts colleges, it is essential to note that no two colleges are alike. Let's examine some of the more unique characteristics of these eight top LACs!

Grinnell College
Joe Bagnoli, the Vice President of Enrollment at Grinnell, gave an informative presentation about Grinnell College in Iowa.

Grinnell College

Grinnell is routinely ranked in the top five for best classroom experiences in the country. The college puts an emphasis on curricular choice for students which means that students are able to explore the things they are passionate about. There is no core curriculum at Grinnell–the Individually Advised Curriculum at gives students the opportunities to design their own course of study based on their interests.

At Grinnell, every student has a career coach and a personal academic advisor. This type of personal guidance ensures that students are confident in their goals beyond college and are able to receive help in achieving their dreams. This emphasis on career planning may explain why Grinnell ranks seventh nationally for the rate at which graduates go on to earn PhDs.

Financially, Grinnell is able to support its students through a $3 billion endowment. Students are given need-based financial aid that includes a no-loan financial aid practice. Merit aid opportunities are also available for students. At Grinnell, students are able to learn and grow outside of their academics with over 150 student groups on campus. In addition, there are plenty of free opportunities to learn and to start personal projects like free music lessons.

Jess Lord, the Vice President of Admissions at Haverford College in Philadelphia, spoke about the distinctive opportunities at Haverford.

Haverford was founded in 1833 by the Quakers and thus has a strong focus on learning, community, and living a life in alignment with your values. Students are able to broaden their mind by interacting with students from all over the United States. In addition, Philadelphia is a short train ride away, and students can go into the city to participate in community events.

Students are given lots of agency and the school fosters a “shape your own path” mindset. Students are not only given the opportunity to conduct research– completing research is the norm. Students are also expected to produce a senior thesis. To supplement their learning, there are plenty of academic centers and spaces that help students go beyond the traditional classroom. There are Maker Arts Spaces, conferences on campus, study abroad opportunities (Peace and Global Citizenship Program), degree partnerships for engineering students with universities like UPenn and CalTech, and a student council all for students to take part in and learn from.

The Dean of Admissions at Kenyon, Diane Anci, spoke about the natural beauty and the strong academic opportunities at Kenyon.

Kenyon is located in Ohio and offers more than 50 majors, minors, and concentrations. Students take full advantage of these opportunities–around ⅕ of students pursue a double or self-designed course of study. As with most liberal arts colleges, there is a low student-to-faculty ratio which means opportunities to engage directly with professors. A third of students major in the sciences and many pursue research that is published and presented at conferences.

Kenyon students are regular recipients of Goldwater scholarships and Fulbrights. Kenyon is known for its excelled Division 3 swimming team, and it is considered one of the best D3 schools in the country.

Kenyon is also home to the well-known literary magazine The Kenyon Review, and the college is known for its Creative Writing programs. Kenyon counts many notable literary figures among its alum, including E.L. Doctorow, Laura Hillenbrand, and John Green.

Macalester’s Vice President of Admissions and Financial Aid, Jeff Allen, discussed the various opportunities after Macalester College and how students can benefit from them.

Macalester is a residential liberal arts and sciences college with around 2100 students from all 50 states and more than 95 countries. It is located in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis–Saint Paul) which are known for their thriving theater and fine arts scenes, diverse communities, and Fortune 500 companies.

There are four core values at Macalester: academic excellence, internationalism, multiculturalism, and service to society.

Being located near two cities means countless opportunities for students to get involved in activism, applied research, and volunteering. For example, political science majors are can intern at the state capital, anthropology majors can participate in ethnographic research, and theater majors can participate in the fine arts area.

Learn more about Macalester and add it to your favorites. Sarah Lawrence College
Kevin McKenna, Vice President for Enrollment, gave an enlightening presentation about Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York.

Sarah Lawrence College is a co-education liberal arts college made up of 4100 undergraduate students. Students come to Sarah Lawrence from all over the US and from 50 different countries. Students benefit by being right next to NYC but are still able to get a residential experience by living in the suburbs.

Sarah Lawrence has a unique academic model in that it is an open curriculum (there is no common core). Everyone has the opportunity to build their own curriculum and own degree pathway with an academic faculty member who serves as their advisor for all four years. Classes are in seminar-style or lab-based classes, so they are all 15 students or less. Everyone in every seminar generates a semester-long independent research or academic project which goes beyond the scope of the seminar and can include whatever the students wish to study.

Sarah Lawrence is a destination for creatives and has one of the largest undergraduate creative writing programs. The proximity to New York City makes it easy for students to connect and learn from authors, agents, and publishers. The art program also takes advantage of the location. A weekly van takes students to visit the city’s many galleries and museums, and many students intern in the art community. Beyond the classroom, there is a vibrant campus culture with plenty of events, and varsity sports alongside a small tight-knit inclusive community.

Jennifer Sandoval-Dancs, Vice President of Admission, provided an illuminating discussion about the various aspects of Claremont McKenna College.

Claremont McKenna is a comprehensive liberal arts college located right above Los Angeles. With over 4100 students, the mission of the college is to engage students in a way that encourages them to live thoughtful and productive lives. The faculty-to-student ratio is quite low at 8:1.

There are plenty of academic opportunities for students with around 33 different academic programs and 11 sequences (similar to minors). This wide spread of subjects allows students to take their classes in an interdisciplinary blend. To add to this, the college brings out speakers to speak about all different disciplines. This ties back to Claremont McKenna’s mission to engage with the leaders of today. Claremont McKenna is all about challenging a student’s perspective which is why diversity is an important standard.

Students at Claremont McKenna complete a senior thesis on a topic of their choice, and students are given the opportunity to work with professors on research. Seventy percent of students report that they have worked on a research.

Matt Bonser, the Vice President of Admissions at Colorado College, talked about the variety of opportunities for academics and personal growth at CC.

Colorado College is a small liberal arts college with around 2,200 students. Colorado College is unique in many ways, but one thing in particular that makes it stand out is its Block scheduling system, which enables students to take one course at a time. Each block consists of a singular class for 3.5 weeks. There are four blocks per semester and classes meet from 9 am to 12 pm, meaning that students are in class for the morning and then have afternoons and evenings free for sports and activities, and to study and prepare for their next class. This system was created so that a student could dive deeply into one subject without being distracted by other classes.

The campus is almost 100 acres, which means there is a plethora of natural sites for students to explore. Students are also heavily encouraged to study abroad to gain a global perspective.

Learn more and add Colorado College to your favorites. Connecticut College
Andy Strickler, Dean of Admissions, provided an informative presentation about the special aspects of Connecticut College.

Connecticut College is located right beside the Thames River which adds to the campus's natural beauty and also provides academic opportunities, like analyzing water quality in the river. Connecticut College is only two hours away from New York City which means that students can easily take a trip to visit the big city if they’re missing urban life.

There is plenty of diversity on campus, with over 81 percent of students being from outside Connecticut. Over 97 percent of students live on campus for all four years. Connecticut College has an honor code, which means finals can be taken at any time and are not proctored. Students are expected to keep up with this honor code and to be responsible for others as well.

Connecticut College requires two things: a semester of a world language and a First-Year Experience class. Students are provided an academic adviser, staff adviser, career adviser, and student adviser to help them on their journey to success at and beyond college. Students need to declare a major by the end of their sophomore year. Over half of students study abroad at some point in time. Hale Center for Career Development provides students with a four-year career prep plan, pre-professional advising, flexible career funding (up to $3000 from the Hale Center), and engagement with the employer relations team.

Connecticut College has been test optional for over ten years, and doesn’t require an application fee.

Tepatnya adalah halaman untuk mengatur beberapa komponen di dashboard. Di halaman tersebut saya membuat beberapa efek transisi yang cukup kompleks.

Setelah teringat dengan waktu development yang sangat mepet, saya berkonsultasi dengan salah satu developer mengenai efek transisi yang barusan saya bikin.

Saya berasumsi bahwa developer tersebut pasti akan menolak mentah mentah penggunaan efek transisi tersebut.

Setelah melihat efek transisi tersebut, Dia berkata “Coba kamu jelaskan keuntungan penggunaan efek transisi seperti ini? , Jika memang itu akan membantu user dalam menggunakan halaman ini, sesulit apapun akan aku implementasikan”

Suatu sore di Jakarta, 3 tahun yang lalu, Saat itu saya dan teman saya sedang menunggu waktu untuk meeting pembahasan fitur baru. Teman saya bercerita bahwa dulu pernah mengerjakan suatu project dan proses nya sangat lama, lebih dari perkiraan waktu awal.

Akhirnya, ia memutuskan untuk menghentikan project tersebut, lalu mengajak semua orang yang terlibat untuk membahas apa faktor utama penyebab project tersebut berjalan sangat lama.

Dia berkata pada saya “Ketika kamu mengerjakan suatu project, dan project tersebut tidak berjalan lancar, jangan lanjutkan. Berhenti sejenak… cari tahu masalah utamanya, temukan solusinya baru lanjutkan project nya”

Saya bersyukur pernah bekerja di Jakarta sehingga bisa mendapatkan banyak cerita, dan saya juga bersyukur bahwa dulu saya berinisiatif untuk mencatat cerita tersebut di buku catatan, sehingga saya bisa menuliskan cerita tersebut disini.

Bawa selalu buku catatan dan pena mu. Cobalah untuk mencatat setiap pengalaman kerja yang kamu alami.

Suatu hari, ketika kamu atau temanmu mengalami kondisi yang sama, kamu bisa kembali mengingat pengalamanmu yang lalu dengan mudah.

Dan pelajaran atau solusi di masa lalu bisa kamu coba terapkan pada kondisi saat ini.

67,Pengalaman Pertama Menyapa Rinjani via Jalur Aik Berik,12/16/2018,Eunike K,https://euniceapril.medium.com/pengalaman-pertama-menyapa-rinjani-via-jalur-aik-berik-55d917309656,"Jalur Aik Berik merupakan salah satu jalur yang masih merupakan bagian dari Geopark Gunung Rinjani. Pendakian yang biasa dikenal kebanyakan orang melalui Sembalun dan Senaru, hingga tulisan ini dibuat memang masih ditutup akibat gempa yang melanda Lombok sepanjang Juli hingga Agustus silam. 2 jalur komersil yang paling banyak menarik pengunjung tersebut belum memperlihatkan tanda-tanda akan dibuka dalam waktu dekat, apalagi kemungkinan dibukanya jalur menuju Puncak Rinjani di 3726 mdpl sangat kecil sekali karena banyaknya longsor. Kabar yang saya dapatkan dari pengelola TNGR di Lombok Tengah, ada kemungkinan jalur Sembalun akan dibuka pada pertengahan tahun 2019, namun mungkin hanya sampai ke Pelawangan Sembalun.

Terlepas dari jalur komersil Sembalun yang kabarnya bisa mendatangkan kurang lebih 1,000 pengunjung per hari, ternyata Geopark Gunung Rinjani memiliki jalur lainnya yang tidak kalah indah. Beberapa di antaranya adalah:

1. Jalur Senaru: biasanya digunakan para pendaki untuk jalur turun, namun jika ingin naik dari jalur ini ujung-ujungnya juga harus melewati Pelawangan Sembalun jika ingin sampai ke Puncak Rinjani. Jalur ini sudah resmi.
2. Jalur Timbanuh atau jalur Selatan: menurut rekan yang pernah melewati jalur ini, tingkat kesulitannya cukup tinggi dan sangat menantang sampai merayap di tebing. Tidak ada jalur untuk menuju ke Puncak Rinjani dari sini, posisinya kalau tidak salah ada di belakang Gunung Barujari, si gunung kecil yang ada di Segara Anak. Hanya bisa sampai plawangan saja karena jalur menuju danau masih curam.
3. Jalur Torean: jalur yang belum resmi ini kalau tidak salah juga digunakan beberapa pendaki untuk turun, saya kurang tahu tepatnya, hanya bermodalkan mencari informasi dari rekan dan internet. Jalur ini begitu indah dengan bukit-bukit tebing besar kehijauan, ada air terjun di ujung tebing, nuansanya seperti sedang di film The Lost World. Salah satu jalur indah yang memang tidak dilewati kebanyakan orang.
4. Jalur Tete Batu: jalur yang kalau tidak salah juga baru dilewati Sam Kolder dan Bryn North 2 minggu lalu ini memiliki view yang tidak kalah cantik. Meskipun tidak sampai ke Puncak Rinjani tapi ketinggiannya yang berada di 3200 mdpl membuat sang pendaki berada di atas awan, Segara Anak juga terlihat dari kejauhan. Jalur ini belum resmi ya teman-teman.
5. Jalur Aik Berik: nah, untuk jalur yang satu ini ada baiknya saya ceritakan saja ya. Kebetulan saya baru saja mendaki via jalur ini pada tanggal 8–9 Desember 2018 lalu.
Pagi itu saya bertolak dari Mataram tepatnya dari Jalan Kulintang 1, sebuah homestay bernama Dylan’s Guest House (tarif per malam Rp 170,000. Bisa order di Traveloka) mulai pukul 08:30 pagi. Tadinya saya dan teman saya Rendy berencana untuk pergi pukul 08:00, tapi ada halangan kompor rusak sehingga harus dicari dulu penggantinya. Kecewa karena tidak dapat pengganti, kami langsung beranjak ke pintu Geopark Rinjani yang ada di Lombok Tengah. Pada Oktober 2018 lalu, saya sempat berkunjung ke lokasi ini untuk melihat Air Terjun Benang Stokel dan Benang Kelambu, baru saya ketahui ternyata ini juga menjadi Pintu Rimba (pintu pendakian) Jalur Aik Berik untuk melihat Segara Anak dan Puncak Rinjani.
Kami tiba di Gerbang Geopark Rinjani, Lombok Tengah sekitar pukul 10:00 kalau tidak salah. Di sana saya dan Rendy langsung mengunjungi pos di dekat tanjakan pintu masuk dan menanyakan di mana harus melapor untuk melakukan pendakian. Sayang sekali mungkin karena sistemnya baru dan mungkin kami juga kurang riset, intinya kami salah tanya. Saran buat teman-teman yang mau ke sini, saat sampai di pintu gerbang yang fotonya ada di bawah ini, kalian turun sedikit ke bawah, ke kantor pengelola TNGR.
Kalau kalian langsung ke pos yang ada di atas, nanti jadinya kaya kami, langsung ditembak oleh guide tanpa tahu prosedurnya seperti apa. Mana kami sempat mau sekalian sewa kompor dan jatuhnya mahal banget. Untungnya orang di pos berbaik hati (siapapun kamu kak, terima kasih ya sudah mengarahkan saya dan Rendy untuk ke kantor TNGR yang ada di bawah). Dia bilang coba ke kantor dulu untuk tanya-tanya soal tiket misalnya sudah daftar online. Oh ya, ingin memberitahukan bahwa teman-teman sebaiknya booking trip ini melalui aplikasi eRinjani. Terus terang app ini absurd banget sih, saya kurang mengerti faedahnya tuh mau untuk online payment berbagai service atau one stop information untuk segala sesuatu tentang Rinjani. Silakan booking tiket masuk melalui app ini, biaya Rp 5,000 per orang (plus biaya admin totalnya Rp 12,500) untuk WNI dan Rp 150,000 untuk WNA. Sayangnya sih biaya asuransi senilai Rp 10,000 dikenakan pembayarannya saat di kantor TNGR, kenapa nggak disekalianin aja gitu ya di app? (seriusan tolong dibenerin ya TNGR, kalian punya aset wisata bagus tapi teknologi dan sistemnya dibagusin, serius deh). Setelah itu info lain misalnya harus pakai guide atau tidak, tarif guide, tarif porter, bisa menyewa perlengkapan di mana, semua informasi yang harusnya dan saya harap ada di app itu, malah tidak ada. Sempat berpikir, ini serius nggak sih membangun pariwisatanya, eh tapi saya ingat-ingat lagi, oh iya saya tinggal di Indonesia, what do you expect, Ke? (sedih ya). Saya jadi terkesan banyak mau, padahal cuma berharap ada sistem yang lebih rapih. Oh ya untuk pembayaran tiket ini, kita diminta top up saldo dulu. Pembayarannya bisa via GO-PAY (anjay lah emang GO-PAY ini ya, mantul!), transfer Bank Mandiri dan e-Cash Mandiri. Saya yakin pasti ada aja yang cranky dengan sistem seperti ini. Mungkin bisa dipermudah lagi dan sosialisasinya yang lebih kencang lagi (halo pengelola TNGR, saya mau loh jadi volunteer untuk konsultan digital kalian, serius gemes akutu ngelihatnya).

Saya melakukan pemesanan ini kurang lebih 2 minggu sebelum pendakian, kalau lihat di sistem, hari itu hanya saya dan Rendy yang melakukan pendakian. Wow! Kalau ingat jalur Sembalun bisa 1,000 orang per hari, ini 2 orang per hari di Aik Berik. Efek gempa bertubi-tubi di Agustus 2018 lalu memang masih menyisakan luka dan trauma, walaupun seriusan ya, saya ke Lombok Oktober dan awal Desember lalu, Lombok sudah benar-benar bangkit (makanya hayuk lah ke Lombok).

Oh ya, lanjut ceritanya ya. Kami akhirnya turun ke kantor TNGR untuk mendapatkan info lebih lanjut (ini aja udah makan waktu banget dan bikin waktu pendakian makin berkurang karena kita agak ngejar di hari yang sama harus sampai di Pos 4). Di kantor TNGR, kami dibantu banget oleh pengelola. Saya lupa namanya siapa, kalau tidak salah Pak Andra. Gayanya pendaki banget dengan celana selutut, topi ranger dan sepatu gunungnya. Dia mengkomunikasikan bahwa kami harus menggunakan guide dan saya tidak menolak, ogah banget kesasar dan emang untung pakai guide, jadi pas saya udah capek mampus, si bapak guide dengan senang hati bantuin bawa tas, ya biar cepat juga jalannya (pas hari ke-2). Biaya guide senilai Rp 200,000 per hari dan saya tidak mengeluh meskipun harus merogoh kocek senilai Rp 400,000 untuk 2 hari. Tidak hanya itu, kami juga dikenakan biaya Rp 60,000 per orang untuk naik ojek dari kantor TNGR ke Pintu Rimba yang jaraknya 5 km. Terus terang saya merasa sah-sah saja mengeluarkan uang dengan jumlah tersebut, tidak ada rasa pemerasan atau tipu-tipu gimana, yang saya bete cuma ya tidak ada sosialisasi tersebut baik di app, atau di media atau bahkan di websitenya TNGR. Sayang banget kan ya. Mana yang bahas secara proper juga belum ada, jadi saya dan Rendy memang modal nekat aja.

Urusan administrasi berjalan lancar walaupun harus pakai foto QR Code yang ada di pemesanan app eRinjani, pakai nggak ada sinyal segala tapi intinya semua orang di kantor TNGR sangat sangat helpful. Di hari yang sama untungnya ada Pak Jumaah yang standby untuk menjadi guide kami, itu juga nyarinya dadakan. Soal kompor, kami pun mendapatkan pinjaman secara cuma-cuma dari Pak Andra (thank god!) dan dari situ kami mulai perjalanan menuju Pintu Rimba menggunakan ojek.

Urusan pertama selesai, jadi kalau teman-teman ke sini, saya sarankan punya deh kenalan di Lombok yang minimal bisa ngobrol pakai Bahasa Sasak, jadi lebih apa ya, lebih dekat aja dan nggak terkesan kita orang asing. Untungnya saya punya teman ya si Rendy ini memang orang asli lokal yang tinggal di Lombok Timur dan udah sering naik turun Rinjani, jadi ya ngerasa lebih aman deh. Sedikit mundur, kami tidak membawa terlalu banyak perlengkapan aneh. Rendy membawa tenda dan matras, barang paling berat untuk bersama, yang lainnya bawa barang masing-masing. Saya juga membawa carrier sendiri berisikan sleeping bag, jaket dan perlengkapan pribadi serta makanan. Untuk makanan, kami juga sangat nggak rempong. Yang kami bawa ada cokelat seperti Silver Queen dan Snickers (ini saya sih, hahaha, karena malas makan karbo), ada Pop Mie sekitar 5 cup, Roti Tawar, Susu Kental Manis, Roti bantal, Chips Ahoy, Gorengan dan Nasi Kucing yang dibeli di kedai kopi dekat pasar, kopi dan gula, yup itu aja, lagian cuma semalam juga, cukup lah buat bertiga. Untuk air, kita cuma bawa 1 botol Aqua yang 1 liter sama 2 botol yang kecil, pasti cukup banget karena saat riset diketahui ini jalur dengan sumber air terbanyak (sekitar 5–6 sampai ke Pelawangan), jadi tidak perlu repot bawa banyak botol. Lagipula jalurnya adem banget, musim hujan pula, akan sangat jarang berkeringat dan haus.

Baik, kita mulai perjalanan ini.
Waktu yang dibutuhkan dari Pintu Rimba sampai Pos 1 kurang lebih sekitar 1,5 jam. Sebetulnya saya sendiri kurang menghitung waktu. Saya membaca dari banyak pengalaman orang, sebaiknya nikmati saja jalurnya ketimbang bertanya “Ini nyampenya kapan?” karena seriusan bakalan lebih capek. Ya paling saya tanya saja estimasinya kepada Pak Jumaah, guide kami saat itu. Sisanya saya biarkan saja kaki ini melangkah. Saya merasa beruntung menggunakan baju full yang tertutup untuk kaki dan tangan karena jalur hutan ini memang penuh dengan lintah, belum lagi beberapa tanaman berduri. Dengan menggunakan atasan dan bawahan lengan panjang serta sepatu dan kaos kaki ketat, saya meminimalisir kena binatang atau tanaman yang aneh-aneh.

Sebagai baju atasan, setelah lagi-lagi riset, saya putuskan menggunakan ultra heattech dari Uniqlo baik untuk atasan atau bawahan. Atasannya saya double lagi dengan baju berbahan jersey untuk lagi biar kalau basah nggak nyerap kaya katun dan jadi bau, celana juga saya pakai luaran bahan cargo dan layer 1 si legging heattech. Walaupun pemula, saya merasa saya telah memilih outfit yang tepat untuk pendakian di musim hujan dan yang hutan banget seperti ini. Dinginnya baju yang basah tidak langsung diserap kulit, tapi diubah jadi panas. Ini bukan promosi ya, tapi ini baju emang hangat banget, harga nggak bohong, anggap aja investasi ya (per piecenya di Rp 300,000, waktu itu lagi promo dari Rp 400,000).

Agak sialnya karena pakai sepatu, saat menyebrangi salah satu sungai, kaki saya terendam seluruhnya dengan air. Duh, itu yang namanya nggak nyaman benar-benar terasa. Menginjak kaos kaki basah dan terendam itu sangat tidak enak, apalagi perjalanan masih jauh. Yang bisa saya lakukan hanya terus berjalan, lalu saat di Pos 1 saya buka sepatu serta kaos kaki. Kaos kaki saya peras, kaki sudah keriput dan pucat seperti kaki mayat karena menahan dingin, saya sudah deg-degan takut sakit atau nggak enak badan. Untungnya mungkin saya memang dikasih jalan untuk datang ke sini sehingga tidak ada halangan yang aneh-aneh.
Kalau kalian tanya, apa sih bagian paling menyiksa misalnya seperti Bukit Penyesalan di Sembalun atau Tanjakan Cinta yang ada di pendakian Semeru, well, Aik Berik punya Tanjakan Pakis. Indah sih memang, pendakian kanan kiri pakis dengan jalur yang aman, bukan kanan kiri tebing jurang, tapi mendakinya itu untuk pemula, ya saya hanya mau bilang satu kata “Wuedannnn rek!”. Tapi nggak boleh ngeluh soalnya bakal tambah capek, seriusan, dibawa ketawa aja. Saya yang biasanya jutek dan paling betean, mendadak jadi yang paling cerita di antara kami bertiga. Entah karena menutupi kelelahan atau memang terlalu excited.

Di tengah jalan, Rendy harus rela tersengat lebah yang membuat betis kirinya bengkak dan bagian bawah kakinya gatal, untungnya dia masih bisa jalan dengan baik bahkan lebih cepat dari saya. Kami melalui perjalanan dari Pos 1 ke Pos 3 dalam waktu sekitar 3 jam karena kami skip Pos 2 dan tidak mengambil air, kami benar-benar mengejar Pos 4 untuk bermalam. Sayangnya memang tidak kesampaian karena cuaca tidak bersahabat.

Jalur selepas pertigaan Plawangan dan Kondo adalah jalur mengerikan pertama untuk saya yang adalah pemula. Itu jalan setapak yang basah diguyur gerimis dan saya cemas karena sepatu agak penuh tanah, kepeleset dikit udah deh, say goodbye to everybody karena sebelah sudah jurang yang tertutup kabut (beli foldable trekking pole juga mggak guna soalnya tiba-tiba bagian bawahnya copot mulu…daripada bahaya ya mending nggak dipake). Benar-benar saya nggak sempat mengambil banyak foto karena fokus ke Pos 3 untuk duduk dan melewati si jalur ngeri ini (ngeri buat pemula ya, saya nggak tahu buat yang udah hebat naik gunung). Selepas jalur tersebut, atap Pos 3 terlihat dan memang rezeki ya, ketika kami duduk di sana, hujan turun dengan derasnya. Bunyi hujan membuat pos beratapkan seng itu menjadi ribut. Pos itu paling hanya membuat 6 orang dewasa untuk duduk bersama, beruntung sekali hanya kami bertiga yang naik hari itu. Bayangkan saja hujan deras dan harus berbagi spot dengan mungkin 7–8 orang lainnya, mungkin bisa rusak mood saya dan ending-endingnya bete. Saya selalu merasa bersyukur akan perjalanan hari itu.
Kami sempat diskusi panjang tentang mau lanjut ke Pos 4 atau tidak supaya besoknya menuju ke Pelawangan akan semakin dekat. Tapi cuaca makin buruk dan saya takut untuk berjalan lebih jauh di kala gelap (dan saat saya tahu pagi harinya bahwa jalur ke sana seseram itu kalau gelap dan hujan, saya sangat bersyukur). Maka kami memutuskan mendirikan kemah di atas pos. Kami hanya membawa 1 senter besar, saya membawa headlamp yang udah beli mahal-mahal tapi nggak taunya nggak terang-terang amat, malah lebih terang senter dari iPhone. Bapak Jumaah mulai membangun api unggun yang apinya sulit untuk jadi besar karena kayunya kebanyakan basah, belum lagi asapnya malah mengarah ke dalam tenda dan bikin keselek, jadinya ya sudah kami semua meringkuk saja sekitar pukul 20:00 di dalam tenda. Saya sibuk merapikan tenda dan mengambil carrier untuk dijadikan bantal kepala, menata sleeping bag. Sementara Pak Jumaah masih sibuk ngopi dan makan Pop Mie bersama Rendy sambil ngobrol dalam bahasa Sasak yang tidak saya mengerti. Selepasnya saya mulai bersiap tidur, Rendy masih sibuk dengan Salonpas dan Neo Rheumacyl untuk memijat luka bengkaknya karena disengat lebah. Kami mulai terlelap tidur sekitar pukul 10:00.

Ini bukan pengalaman pertama saya camping, tapi ini yang bikin nggak tenang. Maklum saja camping pertama itu di Holbung, Toba, bukan hutan lepas begini. Siapa tahu ada babi hutan, bagaimana kalau tiba-tiba gempa, bunyi angin yang kencang dan mengerikan, saya hanya bisa menutup telinga dengan earphone sambil mendengarkan lagu dan mengedit foto, berusaha mencari distraksi. Tidur semacam nggak tenang karena si Rendy menggigil malamnya (udah tahu naik gunung malah bawa sweater tipis dan SB dia basah pula, alhasil dipinjemin selimut sama Pak Jumaah dan jaket saya direlakan daripada dia kedinginan, saya toh masih punya SB).

Tadinya kami sepakat akan bangun pukul 4 pagi untuk memulai perjalanan, tapi dasar kebo semua, akhirnya kami baru bangun pukul 6 pagi dan berangkat sekitar 06:30 menuju Pos 4. Yang namanya udara pagi di gunung itu bikin happy ya. Sejuk, dingin, menggigil tapi tenang dan sendu.
Perjalan menuju Pos 4 adalah tantangan berikutnya. Saya selalu bertanya sama Pak Jumaah “Pak, yang jalurnya begini berakhir kapan, saya kesal banget” Tuh kan, sudah mulai ngeluh. Bagaimana tidak, ada satu tanjakan yang saya sampai harus dibantu menggunakan tangan oleh Pak Jumaah untuk naik, padahal dari hari sebelumnya saya bisa melakukan semuanya sendiri. Lagi-lagi di gunung itu memang ego diuji banget ya, harus mudah meminta tolong, berkata maaf dan terima kasih. Dari tanjakan itu, Pak Jumaah menawarkan untuk membawa carrier gue demi mempercepat perjalanan dan biar gue gampang bergerak. Di situ mau nangis rasanya bukan karena capek dan merasa nggak bisa, tapi karena ada yang menolong.
Kami berhenti di beberapa sumber air untuk mengisi botol. Saya lagi-lagi mendadak cengeng merasakan langsung air segar di gunung. Murni banget, tidak ada rasa pabrik atau rasa botol, murni, enak, mau diminum terus, rasanya beda banget! Rasa seperti ini yang bikin rindu untuk kembali lagi ke gunung apalagi jalur ini belum komersil dan belum banyak tersentuh tangan manusia (sangat bersih!)
Kumpulan cemara yang menjadi penanda pelawangan sudah terlihat dari tempat saya berdiri ini, terasa sangat dekat tapi tidak sampai-sampai juga. Tanjakannya bikin semangat, di kanan kiri banyak batu yang kata Pak Jumaah terguling pada saat gempa kemarin, saya jadi kebayang kalau ada yang mendaki saat gempa Juli-Agustus lalu, itu kumpulan batu dari atas seramnya seperti apa ya saat jatuh ke bawah. Mendaki dan terus mendaki sesekali berhenti, jalurnya cukup mudah untuk menuju Pelawangan, tidak akan tergelincir, hanya saja mendakinya tiada henti, ya namanya juga jalur gunung.
Semakin dekat ke tulisan Pelawangan Aik Berik, semakin bersemangat pastinya. Pak Jumaah menyerukan “Alhamdullilah” sementara saya terus menanjak dan di sana saya cuma bisa menahan tangis yang nggak bisa keluar, saya terlalu senang.
Sejak Oktober 2018, sepulangnya saya dari perjalanan ke-2 saya ke Lombok tahun ini, saya entah mengapa semacam dapat panggilan terus dari tempat ini. Saya jadi sering lihat explore tentang Jalur Torean, meskipun belum pernah mendaki tapi saya tahu jalur-jalur selain Sembalun bermodalkan internet, saya selalu menangis melihat diri saya terkurung di kamar dan orang lain bisa naik ke puncak tertinggi di Lombok itu, bukan, ini bukan rasa iri tapi ada sesuatu yang dipendam yang ingin dilepaskan. Waktu saya tahu salah seorang selebgram Lombok bernama Zilmi Zola naik selepas Jalur Aik Berik diresmikan, bukan main hebatnya dorongan itu berkecamuk dalam hati dan pikiran saya. Ada yang terus mendorong dan bilang “Udah sana naik!” tapi ada juga yang bilang “Ya, ampun anak kota kaya kamu mana bisa naik ke sana, tuh ke Papandayan, Gede atau Merbabu dulu dan Prau…atau Ijen dulu gih” itu yang terus terngiang di kepala saya. Saat sampai di ketinggian 2,508 mdpl ini saya cuma bisa menutup mulut saya karena terus menganga melihat Segara Anak, Barujari, Puncak Rinjani, saya masih nggak percaya kalau 10 jam lalu saya adalah saya yang saya pikir nggak akan mampu pergi sejauh ini. Ini bukan lagi soal pembuktian, penaklukan, kesombongan atau sekadar naik untuk foto-foto. Saya merasa saya nggak mau turun karena takut rindu untuk ke Rinjani lagi, takut banget balik ke kota tapi hatinya tertinggal di Pelawangan Aik Berik dan benar hal itu kejadian sampai sekarang (akutu tiap malam lihatin gallery foto sambil nangis kangen Aik Berik, mana suasana lagi hujan begini).

Semua lelah terbayarkan, semua pegal jadi tidak berarti. Saya cuma bisa diam sampai-sampai Rendy mengira saya bete dan tidak bersemangat atau tidak tertarik pada apa yang saya lihat. Tapi ya begitu, kalau sudah terlalu kagum, saya bisa sampai bingung harus ngapain (bahkan saat mengetik ini di Starbucks Paskal Bandung, saya mau nggak mau harus menyembunyikan air mata dan menahan napas biar nggak mewek). Saya nggak tahu ini namanya apa. Lebih dari rasa jatuh cinta, lebih dari rasa bahagia, ya mungkin pengalaman orang beda-beda ya, paling tidak itu yang saya rasakan.
Kami berfoto di Pelawangan Aik Berik dan beristirahat selama 1 jam. Rendy sibuk ke sana kemari mengambil video, katanya buat bikin vlog yang sekarang sudah diposting di akun Instagram-nya. Sementara saya cuma berbaring di rerumputan menikmati pemandangan di depan saya, Segara Anak dan langit yang cerah. Andaikan waktu berhenti ya.

Kami pun kembali turun tepat pukul 12:00 karena perjalanan masih cukup jauh. Nah, perjalanan turun ternyata lebih menantang dibandingkan saat menanjak naik. Di situ saya sadar bahwa saya harus belajar banyak bagaimana cara turun yang benar dan baik. Saya penakut, itu saya akui, takut tergelincir, selalu merasa sepatu licin penuh tanah. Karena teknik turun saya salah, ya paha saya sampai pegal-pegal. Sudah diberikan tips kalau turun agak miring, pakai telapak kaki atau tumit jangan ujung kaki, kalau turun jangan terlalu ke depan badannya karena lebih gampang jatuh, ini semua si Rendy yang bilangin dan saya tetap bodo amat mencari jalan terbaik untuk saya turun. Bahkan di beberapa kesempatan saya turun ngegelosor pakai pantat saking takutnya, ampe dibilang kaya orang cacat turun gunung. Di situ seriusan pengen nangis parah, udah tahu baru pertama kali turun gunung terus digituin, tapi nggak patah semangat. Saya mungkin belum berani mencoba, tapi saya yang tahu diri saya dan titik aman saya. Tidak apa tangan kotor dan celana kotor yang penting saya turun dengan aman di jalur yang sebelahnya sudah jurang. Saya bukan orang yang hebat turun gunungnya sudah lebih dari 5–10x naik turun Rinjani, anggap saja ini pengalaman pertama dan saya akan terus belajar.

Di perjalanan turun, memang saya agak lambat. Walaupun tidak melelahkan ketimbang menanjak dan mendaki, tapi turun itu effortnya adalah harus ekstra hati-hati jika tidak mau tergelincir. Ujian sebenar-benarnya dimulai justru saat hari sudah gelap. Saya tidak akan pernah melupakan perjalanan pulang kali itu. Langit gelap, geledek besar dan hujan turun. Saya mengenakan jas hujan dan airnya tetap masuk dari pergelangan tangan karena memang deras banget. Lampu dari headlamp saya membuat jalanan seperti berkabut. Bernafas sedikit, ada uap keluar dari mulut. Di tengah jalan pun saya memberikan headlamp pada Pak Jumaah yang ada di belakang saya dan saya menggunakan senter iPhone yang sudah saya taruh di dalam waterproof plastic holder. Bagi pemula, ini sih combo banget buat saya. Jalur basah licin, bercampur batu dan tanah, menurun licin, alhasil lagi-lagi harus meluncur dengan pantat karena takut tergelincir, sesekali Pak Jumaah membantu saya turun.

Di part itu saya berpikir, perasaan sewaktu mendaki dan turun sebelum gelap dan hujan, cobaannya nggak kaya begini. Ini justru pas jalur udah lumayan (kalo kering ya) dan sudah bukan jalur gunung, kenapa malah ini yang paling berat. Saya semacam dikasih all the challenges dan hal sulit malah pas di akhir-akhir, mau ngeluh susah, mau marah susah, jadi ya diam saja.

Jalur terakhir kami melewati kebon pisang yang jalan tengahnya bolong-bolong dan tidak beraturan. Saya terus terang tidak mau mengarahkan senter ke banyak arah, aduh itu gedebok pisang gede-gede banget udah kaya orang tahu nggak sih, setiap kali melihat Rendy yang berjalan lebih dulu di depan membawa senter, saya selalu bertanya dalam hati, ini Pintu Rimba masih jauh nggak sih, tapi emoh bertanya.

Akhirnya ketika teriakan “Oi!” dibalas di ujung, saya tahu itu para tukang ojek yang menjemput kami untuk kembali ke pintu utama Geopark Rinjani Lombok Tengah. Kami beristirahat dan menghangatkan diri sebelum naik ojek dengan jalur yang bikin lompat-lompat di motor. Sesekali saya harus turun dari motor agar memudahkan yang membawa motor untuk melewati jalur berlobang. Harus turun ketika kaki sudah terbalut kaos kaki dingin yang terendam air, pangkal paha bawah rasanya mau patah tapi masih kuat jalan walaupun sudah seperti orang mabok.

Saat melihat jajaran warung dengan lampu di area pintu Geopark, saya hanya bisa mengucap kata “Akhirnya” dalam hati. Tak terasa baru sampai bawah, rindu itu langsung hadir. Kami disuguhkan kopi dan teh hangat ketika singgah di warung pos Pak Andra (ini seriusan saya lupa namanya ya). Ngobrol sebentar, melakukan pembayaran lalu saya dan Rendy kembali menuju Mataram dengan motor, tanpa jaket, cuma pakai jas hujan, ditemani dinginnya Lombok Tengah malam itu.

Panjang ya ceritanya.

Capek nggak bacanya? Semoga nggak ya.

Konklusi dari saya:
1. Dear pengelola TNGR, coba deh sistem informasi kalian diperbaiki, saya yakin ini jalur yang begitu cantik dan bisa menarik banyak wisatawan, tapi berikan kejelasan pada para wisatawan. Nggak semuanya sabar lho dan banyakan yang cranky.

2. Pastikan jauh dari calo-calo nggak jelas yang menawarkan jasa dengan harga gila-gilaan. Ini memang masih sepi, bagaimana nanti kalau sudah ramai

3. Ini jalur bersih banget parah! Sampai di pos atas pun bersih banget. Saya belajar untuk membakar sampah hingga benar-benar habis, supaya tak perlu dibawa turun tapi tidak mengotori area pos dan hutan juga. Bakar sampahnya ditungguin banget. Kalau ada sampah lain, jangan dilihat aja tapi ikut dibakar, jangan egois kaya “sampah lo sampah lo, sampah gue sampah gue”, harus peduli biar Aik Berik terus seindah ini. Saya akan nangis banget kalau misalnya saya cerita di sini, lalu nanti banyak orang naik dan jadi kotor ketika mungkin saya ke sana lagi barang 5 tahun ke depan.

4. Nggak semua keindahan dapat dinikmati dengan kamera sebagai mata kita. Saya terus terang tidak mengambil banyak gambar profesional dengan mirrorless cam saya. Saya lebih banyak merekamnya di pikiran saya dan sesekali mengambil moment dengan smartphone. Ada hal-hal dalam perjalanan ini yang tidak akan pernah bisa digantikan dengan kamera. Banyak-banyak lah melihat sekitar. Rasakan kabut yang turun, lihatlah bukit yang mencuat dari balik awan, dengarkan suara angin yang kencang itu, lautan awan nun jauh di bawah berkumpul didorong angin.

ps: saya berencana naik via Sembalun kalau memang tengah tahun 2019 akan dibuka, kita barengan ya:) boleh kontak-kontak saya di Instagram @tarinaminusta

68,Sharing Pengalaman Meraih Mimpi Kuliah di Jepang dengan Beasiswa,8/24/2017,cendikial,https://medium.com/@cendikial/sharing-pengalaman-meraih-mimpi-kuliah-di-jepang-dengan-beasiswa-31c76a537670,"Assalammualaikum teman-teman! Sesuai judul, kali ini Cendi bakal sharing pengalaman mencari beasiswa (kesana-kemari) demi mewujudkan mimpi untuk bersekolah di negeri Sakura. Syukur alhamdulillah Cendi berhasil mendapatkan beasiswa dari pemerintah Jepang tahun 2017.

Dulu, aku sempat bernazar, jika mendapat beasiswa ini aku akan berbagi pengalamanku kepada teman-teman yang juga memiliki minat yang besar untuk melanjutkan sekolah ke Jepang. So, disimak yuk!

Stage 1: Mengumpulkan Niat
Persis di bulan Agustus tahun lalu (2016), aku mengalami rasa galau yang luar biasa, haha. Ingin melanjutkan S2 tapi nilai TOEFL ITP masih dibawah standar (< 550) dan masih galau juga mau ambil jurusan apa dan di universitas mana. Di waktu yang sama, aku juga melamar pekerjaan kesana kemari tapi tak kunjung diterima, ditambah jomblo lagi huhu sedihnyaaa hidupku dulu #eh. Saking stresnya, aku sampai pergi ke atas loteng dan melihat langit sambil menangis dan mempertanyakan apakah Allah mendengar doaku atau tidak. Kedengarannya lebay sih, tapi itulah yang terjadi. Aku rasa banyak orang yang mengalami hal yang sama dengan keadaanku pada saat itu. Tapi itulah titik dimana aku berpikir bahwa saat itu juga aku harus mengambil sikap, jika merasa buntu pada rencana A, aku harus segera mengambil rencana B. Bukankah ada banyak jalan menuju kesuksesan?

Aku tegas pada diriku sendiri: “Fokus cari beasiswa S2 ke Jepang”.

Aku mulai mengutarakan keinginanku pada mama, aku masih ingat betul kejadian ini terjadi Sabtu pagi, di dapur. Dengan suara agak pelan, aku bilang ke mama, “Ma, aku mau S2”. Reaksi mama pun sungguh diluar dugaanku.

Mama: “Wah bagus. Syaratnya apa (buat mewujudkan itu)? Nanti kalo ada apa-apa minta uangnya ke Mama aja”.

Cendi: “Mau ikut tes TOEFL iBT ma.. Syarat admission-nya gitu..”

Mama: “Oh, berapa biaya tesnya? Itu nanti sekolahnya pake beasiswa kan? kamu cari aja dulu info kampusnya”.

Semenjak itu, aku jadi sangat bersemangat. Yang tadinya super stres, aku jadi bangkit lagi seperti hape yang baru dicas, seger dan panas (?).

Aku mulai mencari-cari info sekolah yang bakal jadi target aku, mengubek-ngubek abis Google tentang kampus-kampus ternama di Jepang.. Mulai dari Waseda, Todai, sampai akhirnya aku jatuh hati pada Keio University. ❤

Aku tulis semua persyaratannya pada lembaran kertas, lalu kutempel di dinding kamar agar aku selalu mengingatnya.

Aku mulai mendaftarkan diri untuk ikut tes TOEFL iBT. Singkat cerita, nilaiku tidak sesuai dengan target. Aku hanya mendapat nilai 74 di percobaan pertamaku. Benar-benar patah hati rasanya, karena sekali tes TOEFL iBT biayanya sekitar 2,3 juta rupiah. Huhuhuhu maafin ya ma, pa..

Stage 2: Daftar Kuliah
Alur pendaftaran kuliah di tiap kampus beda-beda ya teman-teman. Kali ini aku akan menceritakan prosedur pendaftaran di kampusku. Sama seperti di Indonesia, kampusku menggunakan sistem “ujian dan eliminasi”. Ada 2 tahap, yang pertama tes administratif dan paper. Kita diharuskan mengirim dokumen-dokumen daaaan ujiannya adalah harus menulis rencana penelitian dan menjawab pertanyaan “Apa yang kamu lakukan selama 5 tahun terakhir ini?”. Dalam menulis essay itu, aku benar-benar memikirkan setiap detilnya dan meminta feedback dari teman-temanku. Revisi berkali-kali adalah hal yang biasa~ Lalu kukirimkan semua dokumennya melalui pos. Fyi, dari Bandung ke Jepang memakan waktu 4–5 hari.

Saat itu pengumuman tahap pertama, alhamdulillah aku lulus. Selanjutnya tes wawancara. Tes ini dilakukan menggunakan Skype. Minggu pagi yang cerah, jam 9 pagi, aku diwawancarai oleh 3 orang professor. Wawancara berlangsung 10 menit. Alhamdulillah wawancaraku berjalan dengan lancar, diselingi dengan nyanyian karena salah satu professor menyuruhku menyanyi hahaha.

Contoh pertanyaan pas wawancara:

1. Perkenalkan diri kamu
2. Apa yang bakal kamu lakukan setelah lulus/ apa cita-citamu setelah lulus
3. Bagaimana kondisi kota kamu
4. Apakah kamu pernah ke Jepang
5. Coba nyanyikan satu buah lagu
Super unexpected. Luar biasa memang para professorku, sungguh aku jadi tak sabar bertemu kalian semua :”)

Alhamdulillah, ketika aku sedang berada di kereta aku melihat pengumuman dan aku lulus :”) Aku pun mendapat surat “Acceptance Letter” yang dikirimkan langsung dari Jepang. Senang sekali rasanya.

Stage 3: My First Attempt on LPDP Scholarship
Aku pun mendaftar LPDP batch 4 tahun 2016. Bersama kedua temanku yang sama-sama punya semangat untuk bisa berkuliah di luar negeri, kami berlatih dengan keras dan menyiapkan segala dokumen yang ada. Oh iya, untuk memenuhi syarat LPDP aku menggunakan hasil TOEIC ku. Buat teman-teman yang pengen tahu tips dan trik mengikuti tes TOEIC silahkan baca disini :)

Singkat cerita, kedua temanku lolos beasiswa LPDP sementara aku tidak.

Kecewa? Iya. Kaget? Ngga. Sedih? Ngga juga. Kenapa? Secara batiniah, aku yakin Allah punya rencana lain. Secara logika, tampaknya ada beberapa hal yang menyebabkan kegagalanku mendapat beasiswa LPDP.

Faktor kegagalan dalam LPDP versi Cendi:

1. Ketidaksinkronan jurusan S1 dengan jurusan yang akan diambil di S2
2. Ketidaksinkronan itu pun tidak didukung oleh pengalaman bekerja di bidang yang sesuai dengan jurusan yang akan diambil
3. Masih samarnya rencana setelah lulus S2 (lanjut kerja/jadi dosen/wirausaha)
4. Masih freshgraduate, pengalaman kerja belum ada/kurang dari setahun
5. Masih samarnya rencana penelitian
6. Kurangnya pemahaman dan pendalaman akan informasi jurusan yang akan dituju
7. Semua hal itu tercermin dari jawaban dan sikap kita ketika wawancara
Pada saat itu aku yakin bahwa Allah punya rencana yang lebih indah, yang rezekinya datang dari arah yang tidak terduga-duga. Makanya, aku ga terlalu sedih pas tahu kalo aku gagal. Toh pada hari Jumat yang kelabu itu aku masih tetap mau nonton channel WakuWaku Japan meskipun diledek ayah :”(

Stage 4: Cari Beasiswa Lain!
Gak mau terlalu lama larut dalam renungan kegalauan (halaaaah..), aku memutar otak supaya Acceptance Letter aku ini ga berakhir sia-sia. Aku mengirimkan email kepada 3 professor yang dulu mewawancaraiku yang intinya “minta dibantu kalo ada info beasiswa, mohon diinfokan, soalnya saya gagal dapat beasiswa dari Pemerintah Indonesia, kalau ngga ada beasiswa saya ga bisa sekolah di sekolah impian saya”. Cukup dramatis sih.. berharap ada yang membalas, ternyata ngga dibalas. HUHUHU.

Berdoa teruuuuuus….. Liatin terus gambar kartu pos Yokohama dan tulisan “Saya bisa kuliah di Keio tahun 2017” yang ditempel di dinding.

Suatu hari, saya mendapat email yang menyatakan bahwa ada beasiswa dari pemerintah Jepang. Kalo saya berminat, balaslah email ini. Daaaaan… perjuangan pun dimulai.

Stage 5: Jalan Menuju Beasiswa Monbukagakusho U to U
Sekitar awal bulan Januari 2017, aku mulai mempersiapkan segala dokumen yang dibutuhkan. Semuanya hanya tentang dokumen. Gak ada wawancara dll. Aku hanya terus berdoa agar Allah memberi jalan rezekiku disini.. karena kalau bukan disini, ngga tau lagi mau gimana..

Alhamdulillah dapat email yang menyatakan bahwa saya lolos seleksi untuk tingkat fakultas, selanjutnya tingkat universitas.

Sebulan berselang, alhamdulillah lolos tingkat universitas. Selanjutnya universitas-lah yang akan merekomendasikan kita ke pihak pemberi beasiswa.

Ditunggu berbulan-bulan, dengan perasaan yang super penuh harapan, akhirnya tanggal 30 Mei 2017 jam 7.54 WIB saya dapat email yang isinya “Congratulations!”

ALHAMDULILLAAAAAH YA ALLAAAAH… AYAH SAMA MAMA NANGIS, KITA SEMUA NANGIS DI PAGI YANG INDAH DI BULAN SUCI ITU :”)

Perjuangan selama setahun ke belakang akhirnya berujung manis. Kalau kita yakin bahwa Allah mendengar doa kita dan Allah punya rencana terbaik buat kita, maka pasti ada jalannya!

Aku selalu ingat quotes ini:

Yakinlah akan ada sesuatu yang menantimu, setelah banyak kesabaran (yang kau jalani), yang akan membuatmu terpana hingga kau lupa pedihnya rasa sakit.

Ali bin Abi Thalib.

Itulah pengalamanku dalam menggapai cita-cita bersekolah di negeri Sakura. Teman-teman, doakan aku ya agar lancar kuliahnya, cum laude, dan bisa berkontribusi buat Indonesia suatu hari nanti. Aku pun mendoakan semoga teman-teman yang membaca bisa termotivasi dan bisa juga tercapai cita-citanya berkuliah di luar negeri, khususnya di Jepang. Kalau mau tanya-tanya lebih lanjut, bisa follow Instagram aku ya! See you in the land of rising sun! :)

70,I'm Slowly Learning That I Don't Have To React To Everything That Bothers Me,9/18/2021,Rania Naim,https://thoughtcatalog.com/rania-naim/2017/10/im-slowly-learning-that-i-dont-have-to-react-to-everything-that-bothers-me/,"I’m slowly learning that I don’t have to hurt those who hurt me. I’m slowly learning that maybe the ultimate sign of maturity is walking away instead of getting even.
I’m slowly learning that the energy it takes to react to every bad thing that happens to you drains you and stops you from seeing the other good things in life. I’m slowly learning that I’m not going to be everyone’s cup of tea and I won’t be able to get everyone to treat me the way I want to be treated and that’s okay. I’m slowly learning that trying so hard to ‘win’ anyone is just a waste of time and energy and it fills you with nothing but emptiness.
I’m slowly learning that not reacting doesn’t mean I’m okay with things, it just means I’m choosing to rise above it. I’m choosing to take the lesson it has served and learn from it. I’m choosing to be the bigger person. I’m choosing my peace of mind because that’s what I truly need. I don’t need more drama. I don’t need people making me feel like I’m not good enough. I don’t need fights and arguments and fake connections. I’m slowly learning that sometimes not saying anything at all says everything.
I’m slowly learning that reacting to things that upset you gives someone else power over your emotions. You can’t control what others do but you can control how you respond, how you handle it, how you perceive it and how much of it you want to take personally. I’m slowly learning that most of the time, these situations say nothing about you and a lot about the other person. I’m slowly learning that maybe all these disappointments are just there to teach us how to love ourselves because that will be the armor and the shield we need against the people who try to bring us down. They will save us when people try to shake our confidence or when they try to make us feel like we’re worthless.
I’m slowly learning that even if I react, it won’t change anything, it won’t make people suddenly love and respect me, it won’t magically change their minds. Sometimes it’s better to just let things be, let people go, don’t fight for closure, don’t ask for explanations, don’t chase answers and don’t expect people to understand where you’re coming from. I’m slowly learning that life is better lived when you don’t center it on what’s happening around you and center it on what’s happening inside you instead. Work on yourself and your inner peace and you’ll come to realize that not reacting to every little thing that bothers you is the first ingredient to living a happy and healthy life.","Pengalaman Pribadi, Kesehatan Mental"
71,The Best Revenge Is Self-Love,1/22/2021,Rania Naim,https://thoughtcatalog.com/rania-naim/2017/10/the-best-revenge-is-self-love/,"The best revenge is working on yourself. Forget about getting even, forget about giving them a taste of their own medicine, forget about making them regret the day they hurt you. Let karma handle that because I can assure you that it certainly will, just focus on becoming a better version of yourself. Learn how to forgive people who were not sorry, learn how to let all your negative emotions or anger fuel you to do something more productive, to replace that kind of energy with something that will actually be good for you. Like exercise, a creative project, or just trying out something new so you can distract yourself.
The best revenge is not caring what other people think; not letting their actions affect you, not seeing yourself through their eyes, not trying so hard to impress them and learning that they’re not superior just because they have things you don’t have.
The best revenge is learning to let go rather than hold on. Letting go is truly liberating and it shows that you have faith in God and the universe. Sometimes when we don’t feel good about ourselves, we hold on to things that could sabotage our happiness or people who don’t really value us or love us. But when you learn how to let go of situations or people that are making your life more difficult than it should be, it means that you’ve reached a healthy level of self-love because you’re letting go even though you don’t have any backup, you don’t know what’s next but you’re not afraid. You feel like the universe is looking out for you, you’re confident in your abilities to start over or find someone better. You have learned how to be strong, courageous and not afraid of the unknown. You know that you can handle whatever comes your way.
The best revenge is loving who are now until you become the person you want to be. Loving your imperfect self. Learning from your mistakes. Knowing that you’re not defined by them or by your past. Loving your journey with its ups and downs. Learning that everyone who couldn’t love you is also fighting their own battles and confused about their own journey. Believing that you’re exactly where you’re supposed to be and focusing on making the best out of the life you’ve been given instead of hating yourself for not living the life you want to live.
The best revenge is learning how to be content and happy, even if the odds are against you.","Pengalaman Pribadi, Kesehatan Mental"
72,Why Men Pull Away And Come Back,3/9/2023,Sabrina Bendory,https://thoughtcatalog.com/sabrina-bendory/2023/03/why-men-pull-away-and-come-back/,"Let’s talk about why men pull away and then come back.
It could be a guy you’re casually seeing, or maybe it’s your long-term partner. No matter what the case, it’s disconcerting and you can’t help but feel panicked and on edge.
Did you do something to upset him? Is he losing interest in you? Does he want to break up with you?
These are all terrifying questions to ask … especially when it’s regarding a man you really care about.
The fact is, men do pull away and come back in relationships. It’s a naturally occurring cycle and happens for important reasons. Men and women are different and as such, the way they deal with emotions and stress can be different.
I know it feels confusing but it’s pretty simple really and I’m gonna break it all down for you.
Men typically retreat and withdraw into their “man cave” when dealing with stress or difficulties. That is just the way most men prefer to handle things, as opposed to most women who usually prefer to seek out and lean on those closest to them.
It feels good for a woman to talk to her close friends and family when she’s upset. This doesn’t feel good to most men. Most men feel ashamed when they’re off their game. And the last thing they want to do is be seen by others. Actually, that’s the second to last thing they want, the real last thing they would ever want is to be pitied and receive unsolicited advice from said pitiers. This is crushing and crippling to a man.
A man would much rather withdraw and work through whatever the issue is on his own, and then come back into the relationship when he’s feeling strong and confident again.
You may know about this on an intellectual level, but on an emotional level it hurts because you really wish he would just talk to you. You feel almost offended that he doesn’t want to open up to you. You might think it means he doesn’t really love or trust you. But that’s not the case. He does care, and that’s the reason he’s doing this! He cares so much about what you think that he doesn’t want you to see him when he’s not at his best.
Fine, maybe you would love him no matter what but it’s still not a good feeling for him. So he withdraws and takes space.
These are the most common reasons a man will pull away and take space from a relationship:
1. He’s dealing with problems that have nothing to do with you.
Maybe he’s stressed at work and his job isn’t going well, maybe he’s struggling with anxiety, maybe he’s having family issues, or maybe he’s having financial issues.
Life is filled with potential problems and setbacks, and when they arise, a man will want to take a step back to deal with them. Most men can only process one thing at a time, they can’t juggle and multi-task as efficiently as women. So when something comes up, he will put all his energy and attention into it.

2. The relationship is moving too fast.
Relationships often start out at lightning speed, and this isn’t always healthy. In the beginning, it’s all so exciting and exhilarating so the momentum is strong. You’re flying on a surge of feel-good hormones like Dopamine and Oxytocin.
It seems like things are going great, but a guy may panic at this point just a little bit because things are moving a little too quickly. It doesn’t mean he doesn’t like you or isn’t interested, he just wants to slow things to a more comfortable pace. And really, what’s the rush here? This is a common occurrence in new relationships that started off with a bang.

3. He’s having doubts about the relationship.
This is more common in a long-term relationship. Look, sometimes people have doubts. That’s perfectly normal. If that’s what’s going on, he may want some time away to sort through his feelings. And this will work to your advantage because you not being there gives him the space to miss you.

What will have the opposite effect is if you go into overdrive trying to win him back and prove yourself to him. This will just make him resent you for being unable to give him something he needs (space) and it can make you come across as desperate and needy, which is never a good look.

4. You’re doing something that’s causing him to withdraw.
Maybe you’re being too clingy, too demanding, too negative, something along those lines is recurring in the relationship and he just doesn’t want to deal with it.
Most men want their lives easy and drama-free. The best relationship for a man is one that enhances his quality of life… not one that just adds more stress and burdens. This doesn’t mean you have to be on your best behavior at all times. You can certainly express negative emotions but there is a big difference between doing this in a way where you take ownership of your emotions and reactions… and one where you blame the other person or use your relationship as an emotional dumping ground.

As I said, the first scenario is the most common, but the others are likely as well. You’ll just have to assess your individual situation.
So What Should I Do When He’s Pulling Away?
No matter why he’s pulling away, the advice on how to respond is the same: just give him space and let him do what he needs to do.
If he’s having doubts about you or the relationship, you being right there in his face will not change his mind, if anything it will make things even worse and he may become more annoyed with you and then he will really start rethinking the relationship.
Feeling upset can put us in a very selfish frame of mind. All we see is our pain and we try to find ways out of it. But you need to factor in how he’s feeling and what he needs, that’s what emotional maturity is all about. If he needs space, then it’s unfair of you to decide your need for him to be present is more important.
Try to maintain perspective here and realize that he’s doing what’s best for him, and what’s ultimately best for the relationship. If you just back off and give him space to naturally come back to you, then he will, and he’ll be even better and stronger and more of the partner you need. If you suffocate him, he’ll just resent you.
Just play it cool, focus on yourself, let him know you’re there if he wants to talk, and then just let it be.
Obviously, this shouldn’t drag on forever. He can’t just keep you on the back burner. So give it a few weeks and then reassess what’s going on. If he’s not coming back to you, then it’s likely that he doesn’t want to and is just buying more time.
Either way, use this time to better yourself. That’s the best thing you can do for yourself and your relationship. Look at your life and at the way you feel about yourself and see if you can find areas of improvement. Then set small, achievable goals for yourself to get there.",Percintaan

I don’t want to intentionally make you feel like a bad partner. I’m just trying to trust you and believe in what we have. And sometimes, it’s hard for me because I’m skeptical.
You might catch me crying in my bathroom quietly, because I don’t want you to hear. Or, you might hear me absolutely sobbing in my car for no apparent reason.
You might even see hints of jealousy when you mention another girl from your past. But you won’t ever hear me say a word about it. Instead, I’ll worry about it.
I hate to admit that I’m always skeptical when it comes to relationships because I’ve been damaged before. It’s no excuse, and I know I can’t compare you to the people from my past.
But it isn’t you that’s the problem — it’s simply what my mind is used to being. I’ve let my guard down and trusted as if I’ve never been broken before, only to be shattered shortly after.
Once I see red flags that remind me of my past, my fear overwhelms me and my mask cracks. I don’t want to look like an idiot again.
I’ve been that girl who does everything for the one she loves while being happily blissful. And he’s secretly deceiving her behind her back.
I’ve been cheated on, used, lied to, and manipulated. But I’ve also been embarrassed by my actions of loving someone I shouldn’t have. Someone I trusted, even though the red flags were there.
And I don’t want to be that girl again. I’d rather know what’s happening and ask the hard questions. I’d rather look like a crazy girl at times to put my mind at ease than to look like a blind fool later on.
In my opinion, communication is extremely important. However, I know that my blunt ways could be seen as rude or aggressive.
But I don’t trust myself and my judgment as much as I should. I just want to show you that I trust you, even if it isn’t coming off in the way I intend it to.
Are my feelings for you clouding my vision? Are those rose-colored glasses too tinted? In my mind, I’m worried you’re not the perfect person I have been led to believe you are.
Nevertheless, deep down, I pray you are. I want to believe I’m finally right about someone.
Over time, you’ll see me get more comfortable and less skeptical as our relationship grows and our bond strengthens. But for now, all I ask is that you see my strong emotions for what they are.
They are a passion for you and my way of growing to love you more than I ever thought I could. As a result, you’ll love that when I’m happy when I’m ecstatic. And you’ll laugh at me when I’m annoyed, frustrated, and fuming.
And you can get frustrated all you want when I’m overreacting, but just know that I do it because I care.
I’ll continue to be skeptical because I care and our relationship means a lot to me. Believe me, if you meant nothing to me, you’d notice that I’d be numb to you.
And I think we both know that you’d rather see my overflow of emotions than my silence.

74,The Difference Between Being Unlucky In Love & Sabotaging Yourself With Negativity,5/12/2023,Orna and Matthew Walters,https://www.yourtango.com/love/unlucky-in-love-or-sabotaging-negative-attitude,"Do you struggle with a negative attitude about love and relationships? Do you fear that love just isn’t in the cards for you? Well, don’t worry, with the right approach you can overcome your negative attitude about love and restore your hope. You aren’t destined to struggle for the rest of your life.

How you think about love and relationships is one of the biggest factors in your success. Changing your mindset and your attitude will change your results.

If you have a negative attitude, there is hope for you. Here are some real-world practical ways of understanding how your mindset is affecting your search for love.
How a negative attitude prevents you from finding love
1. A negative attitude influences your worldview
If you believe that most men are cheaters, or that most are only interested in sex and not a relationship, then you will see evidence that proves your conviction all around you. Conversely, if you believe that most people are kind, or that love is easy to find, you will have experiences meeting a lot of nice people and find love easily.

The world appears to you as you believe it to be. One could also say that what you believe is true is true for you.
Your beliefs determine your experience of the world around you. Sadly, most people believe the opposite — they think it is their beliefs that are shaped by the world.

As a newborn, you came into the world as the physical embodiment of the energy of love with zero blocks. You gave love freely to anyone who was around you, and you received love freely from anyone willing to give it.

Then you learned in your family of origin that love is conditional and you developed strategies that still affect you to this day.

Once you are grown, it takes an open mind or a powerful experience to change your beliefs about how the world operates. What’s interesting though is that human beings are actually designed this way.
Your mind is wired to find evidence for what you already believe and to reject evidence that contradicts your beliefs.

This wiring is what helps you to survive in a complex world. If you had to evaluate all new information from a clean slate (a completely unbiased mindset) then you wouldn’t be able to quickly make decisions and act on the evidence in front of you.

Because you have a negative attitude about love and relationships, you’re filtering for evidence to confirm your beliefs. There are plenty of relationship-ready men looking for love on a dating site or app. It’s your negative beliefs about dating that block you from seeing them.

You’ve programmed your mind to find the men who are a match to your belief system. Changing your beliefs will change your experiences online and offline.
We’ve guided our clients to have dramatic changes within a few weeks by providing a new experience for them. Everything from finding attractive available men in a tiny rural community to finding an ideal match in a bustling metropolis later in life, and everything in between.

When you examine your belief system and poke holes in it, the doorway to new experiences opens for you. This allows you to release the beliefs that don’t serve your desires.

Take some time to look at what is beneath your negative attitude. Is it protection against heartbreak? Is there unresolved grief from a failed relationship? Or are you holding on to a belief system from your childhood that says you are unlovable?

Through introspection, you can determine which beliefs serve you toward your life goals, and which ones are keeping you from the experiences you desire.
2. A negative attitude affects your actions
Your behavior is driven by your thoughts and your feelings. In fact, there is a system for how this works. It’s called the Think, Feel, Do Cycle.

First, you have a thought. This thought triggers an emotion. And the emotion affects the actions you take, (whether or not you take an action).

When your thoughts are generally negative, they’ll trigger negative emotions. Your negative attitude will cause you to take fewer risks, stick to your familiar routines, and reject new opportunities. All of this will lead you to have fewer opportunities to meet new people, make new connections, and have new experiences.
Your negative attitude is keeping you stuck, and your feeling stuck is contributing to your negative attitude. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy that will take some willpower for you to break.

This never-ending cycle requires you to make an effort to change. You won’t magically wake up one day feeling more positive and suddenly feel differently about love. You’ll have to take new actions in order to feel better. And that may require you to pay more attention to your negative thoughts.

Look for reasons to stay positive. Practice affirmations. Contradict your negative thought patterns with evidence that what you wish to believe exists in the world. Notice love in all its many forms all around you.

A client of ours held tightly to the belief that in order to have love one would have to be lucky. So we decided that she would have to become a lucky person. One month later she won the Super Bowl pool at her office. Voila! She now had evidence that she was, in fact, a lucky person.
You have more control over your thoughts than you know. And when you take control of your thoughts you start to feel better, which has an effect throughout the Think, Feel, Do Cycle.
3. A negative attitude will make you judgmenta
l

One of the more corrosive effects of a negative attitude is that it causes you to be more critical and judgmental of the world around you.

In our opinion, judgment is the #1 biggest block to love. Here’s why…
At its root all judgment is self-judgment. And when you are judgmental you are more inclined to project that judgment onto others.

This makes it difficult for any person you’re dating (or potentially dating) to live up to your judgment and criticism. Constantly finding fault with those around you creates disconnection. And feeling disconnected is the beginning of the end of any relationship (no matter how hot, sexy, or kind they might be).

Instead, create a connection with your dates by focusing on their positive qualities. This doesn’t mean that you excuse bad behavior. It does mean that you don’t sweat the small stuff. Go on some dates and just enjoy getting to know another human being with zero expectation of anything that may come after.

Breaking a pattern of judgment is just like breaking any habit – it requires a commitment and a strategy. First off it is important that you focus on progress, not perfection.


Start the day with a stretchy bracelet on one wrist and every time you catch yourself being negative or judgmental move the bracelet to the other wrist. Your goal is to not move the bracelet for 30 days straight.

We gave this assignment to a client we had back in 2009. She was shocked at how her negative voice was embedded in every part of her life leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Within a few weeks of moving the bracelet back and forth, she found that all her relationships were improving. And what was most surprising for her was that she was still not “perfect” at ending the habit yet.

Your efforts toward change count more than we can explain here. You’ll have to try it out for yourself to experience it.

Most of all be kind, compassionate, and loving to yourself through this process.
4. A negative attitude can cause you to miss opportunities
When you have a negative attitude you are more likely to look for reasons to say, “No.” “No,” to a possible date. “No,” to giving someone a second chance. “No,” to an adventure.

Love requires that you risk. It is a risk to meet someone new. It’s an even bigger risk to fall in love with someone.

The myth of accidental love leaves you wishing that your ideal man will see through all your negativity and love you despite it. It requires you to hope and wish that someone will counteract your negativity and bring happiness into your life.
It’s as if you’ve locked yourself into a fairytale tower expecting that the right man will find his way up there to rescue you and make your life better.

Ultimately, you’re the only person responsible for your happiness. Only you can change your negative attitude.

It starts by saying “Yes” instead of “No.” Say “Yes” to a date with someone new. Say “Yes” to go to that party where you won’t know anyone. Say “Yes” to a new adventure.
Take charge of your attitude by saying “Yes” to risk your heart. You’ll find that your path to love becomes clearer and your connection to others a lot stronger.
We had a client who was very resistant to dating apps because she had only bad experiences using them. Because she lived in a small town, she really needed to use the tool that made meeting new men easy. So we removed her blocks to dating apps. She is now married to the 2nd man she met online who lived one town over from her.

You can decide that your ideal man is looking for you just as you are looking for him. What would be different if this was your primary belief in your search for love?
5. A negative attitude can repel the kind of person you want
Negative people are not very fun to be around. They tend to bring the energy and mood down for everyone else.
If you’re craving lasting love with someone who loves you for who you really are, you have to show up as who you really are. You learned your negative attitude. It’s not your true nature.

Do you want to stop being the dark cloud that rains on everyone else’s happiness?

Start by being curious about the people you meet. Curiosity is very attractive.


Practice being curious with strangers you meet at the grocery store. Or be curious about people in the line at your coffee shop. Be curious about that stranger you’re meeting for the first time.
Your curiosity will be a magnet to draw new people to you. Remember, every person you meet knows people you have not met yet. You never know where the introduction to your beloved will come from.

Taking time to examine your negative attitudes and making an effort daily to shift to a more positive attitude will shift your experience exponentially. You don’t have to change everything all at once.

Attempting to will only lead to frustration and failure. Instead, pick one item from your list and focus on it for a few weeks. You’ll be surprised at how quickly everything in your life will get better.",Percintaan
75,An Open Letter To The Love I Hope To Have,5/4/2023,Madison Flatman,https://www.yourtango.com/love/open-letter-to-love-i-hope-have,"To the person who loves me next,

I hope you remember my favorite candy as you are walking into the grocery store. As you grab my favorite candy off the shelf, you hear a song playing from overhead.

You laugh as you remember it’s a song I’ve always loved to sing along to. You start to hum along as you pick up the rest of the things you need.
On the way home, you pass by the places we’ve explored together. You picture the way my cheeks turned cherry red as we trekked through the winter cold and the way my eyes sparkled through the summer sunset.

We’ve constantly lived a life of endless adventures, as we both know life is too short to live a life we settled for.

As you walk into the home we share, our pets greet you. You put down the groceries on the kitchen floor as you reach out to pet them. You love them unconditionally and just as much as you love me.

You reach into your bag to bring out a couple of toys for them to play with. From there, you begin to put away the groceries.
Our fridge is perfectly stocked with beverages and snacks. Our cabinet is filled with blankets and board games we’ve played.

We want to have a place where others feel welcome to come to chill out. We want our home to be as comfortable as the comfort we find in each other.

You turn on the television in the living room as you watch the evening news. Your mind can’t even begin to unravel the thought process of how unsympathetic many people are.
This makes you sad. You take a deep breath and turn off the television. You realize we are safe in each other’s presence.
You walk throughout our house as you see the pictures hanging on the wall and the decorations perfectly placed on the shelf. Every item represents our lives together but also our lives as individuals.

We’ve learned to co-exist because we want each other to love the world around us. We may not always share the same memories, but we support each other as we make them.

As you make your way to the bedroom, you see me laying there. My eyes are swollen red as I’m wrapped in a blanket. My cluttered mind focuses on you as you come into the room.
You hand me my favorite candy as you lay in bed with me. You wrap your arms around me and you don’t have to say a word because I know you love me.

I hope you love me even on the days I can’t smile.

76,I Decided To Talk To People Who Have Been Single For 10 Years. Here's What Life Is Like For Them,5/2/2023,Ossiana Tepfenhart,https://www.yourtango.com/love/decided-talk-people-been-single-for-years,"Most of us have experienced a dry spell in love. Some of us were late bloomers, others were just not in a good situation, still more may have lost interest, while a scant few just had bad luck.

Whatever the reason, the vast majority of us eventually get our groove back and find a new partner, albeit with some work. Some people, though, are a little different.

Whether by choice, by their own fault, or by a bad dating pool, some people end up staying and being single. It's just what happens; not everyone finds the right person to be with.

Most of us assume that those who stay single for decades are lonely, desperate, or messed up. I decided to talk to some people who were single for 10 years.
I asked them when their last relationship was, why they broke up, how life is as a long-term single, what they think keeps them single if they wanted to get married, and if they'd date someone again.
Here's what people who have been single for 10 years have to say about what life is like for them:
1. Lucas, 37
When was your last relationship?

College.

Why did you break up with your ex?

I tried to have sex with her friends. Ends up no one else wanted to be with me.

What is life like as a long-time single?

I'd like to say it's fun, but it's not. I am very lonely. I wanted to have kids at one point, but I don't anymore. My career benefits from it, though. I really was able to immerse myself in my work, and I’m very creative with it. I also have plenty of friends, but it’s not the same.
I still occasionally go on Tinder, but I don’t see it as a long-term relationship pool. Most women do not want to marry someone who works in nightlife or hip-hop. Those who do have serious drug problems or expect me to “settle down.” I’m not giving up my career for someone.

What keeps you single?

Finding someone in the industry and crowd is hard. You have a lot of people who have serious problems, like drugs or emotional issues. The girls who have their s*** together don’t want anything to do with me because of my career.
Do you still want to get married? Do you still want to date?
Yes and yes. I’m not gonna stop searching.
2. Frances, 45
When was your last relationship?

My marriage. I divorced at 32.

Why did you break up with your ex?

My ex was very abusive. I divorced him after he beat me into miscarrying.

What is the long-term single life like?

Well, I wake up in the morning, greet my dog, and feed him. I make breakfast, watch the news, and head to the office. I do my work. Then, I figure out what I want to do that night. Do I want to stay home? Go to the art gallery? Hit up hot yoga? Work on a new business venture?
I’ll admit, at times, I look at couples and get lonely. I have friends, but it’s not the same as a lover, you know? I then remind myself why I’m single, and then the feeling passes pretty quickly. Once in a while, I’ll have a one-night stand. That’s about it.

What keeps you single?

I do. I don’t want to be with men after the things they put me through. I have never had a healthy relationship, and I no longer want to pursue one. There’s only so much effort you can put into finding someone before you decide it’s not worth it.

Do you still want to get married? Do you still want to date?


Nope. I prefer my own company.
3. Gregori, 35
When was your last relationship?

High school. I was 17.

Why did you break up with your ex?

She broke up with me. Said she didn’t like me anymore, and felt it was unhealthy. I think it was because I was a nerd and she felt she could do better.

What is the long-term single life like?

I try to be nice to girls, but they reject me. The dating scene can be so shallow for a nice guy like me. I don’t have much money, and I don’t have looks. Girls don’t want me. I get angry sometimes. Like, I put in effort, why can’t they just be fair and reciprocate?
What keeps you single?

I don’t know. The girls’ preferences? Their awful attitudes? My desire is for a more old-fashioned lady who can provide and also keep a house clean. Honestly, most girls aren’t worth it.

Do you still want to get married? Do you still want to date?

I don’t think I’d get married. I want to get laid, but I don’t want women to get half my stuff.
4. Alana, 42
When was your last relationship?
I was 30 when it ended.
Why did you break up with your ex?

It just wasn’t working out. He wanted kids, and I didn’t.

What is the long-term single life like?

At first, I was desperate to find the one. I kept dating, but nothing really clicked. Eventually, the amount of time and effort I was putting in was no longer worth it. I felt like I wasn’t getting enough reward, so I said, “F*** it.”

Just like that, I stopped dating. I used to feel like I was missing out, but seeing so many ugly divorces made me rethink that. It hurts sometimes, but overall, I feel like I have a pretty awesome life. I do a lot of classes, have friends, and see museums. I feel free, to be honest.
What keeps you single?

I just feel like I’m satisfied with the way my life is. The men my age are trainwrecks and are not worth my time. At this point, even if I did find someone, it’d be too little, too late. Sorry to sound bitter, but why wasn’t I worth it when I wanted a guy?

Do you still want to get married? Do you still want to date?

I don’t think it’s worth it anymore. I don’t really have any interest in it anymore.

77,How To Get Out Of An Unhappy Marriage Without Getting Divorced,4/23/2023,Mary Ellen Goggin Jerry Duberstein,https://www.yourtango.com/love/how-get-out-unhappy-marriage-without-getting-divorced,"Knowing how to get out of an unhappy marriage isn’t as simple as doing a web search for divorce lawyers. It’s not even necessarily about getting divorced.

There are two components to an ""unhappy marriage"" — unhappiness and marriage.

And when your disappointment, sadness, or downright despair starts making you eye the front door, one or both is the motive. You’re aching to get out of your unhappiness, your marriage, or both.

Some people truly want — and may need — to know how to get out of an unhappy marriage. Abuse, addiction, and ongoing and unrepented infidelity are definitely reasons that warrant the end of a marriage.

How to get out of an unhappy marriage without getting divorced
And, even if they’ve been staying in such a marriage for one reason or another, they would still like to end the misery.
Divorce has its own stages and obvious consequences, no matter who wants it or how amicable it may seem.
And, for some people, those consequences — emotional, familial, or financial — can be enough to put on the brakes and forge a creative solution.
If you’ve been trying to decide whether it’s better to stay in an unhappy marriage or if you're better off getting a divorce, you may have another alternative.
But first, you need to ask yourself some difficult questions about your marriage.

Why is your marriage unhappy?
Is the discontent being generated from within the marriage or from without? Have you done everything you can to prioritize your marriage and protect it from outside antagonists?
Do you still respect and care for one another? How does an unhappy marriage affect you — or have you really stopped to notice? Have you asked for help?
Even if the idea of returning to emotional and physical intimacy with your spouse borders on impossible, divorce doesn’t have to happen.
But you have to decide if you can do what needs to be done to redefine your marriage in a livable way. And if you have children, your choice and commitment will be critical.

Practicing detachment.
One way to get out of an unhappy marriage without getting divorced — or even separating — is to practice detachment.
If your relationship has been plagued with chronic annoyances and unresolved arguing, detachment can create some breathing room. It doesn’t solve the problems or the irritating behaviors that trigger your ire, but it allows you to not be affected by their consequences.
Detachment is the practice of allowing each person to be themselves without judgment, criticism, or expectation to change. In a sense, you're walking away without walking away.
You get to shift your focus to yourself and your self-care. Since you no longer have to balance your own wants and needs against the interdependence of the marriage, you can emotionally exhale.

What does detachment look like and why would you choose it?
It looks civilized, respectful, and polite. It doesn’t have the cozy affection of early love, but in a unique way, it still demonstrates love. Conversations are more neutral and the focus is shifted away from the relationship.
If you have children, detachment can be a viable way to keep the family ""together,"" despite the change in marital expectations.
Children get to see their parents speaking respectfully to one another. The arguing is gone — or at least minimized — and the focus shifts to common priorities, like raising kids and making a smoothly running home front.
Even favorite rituals can — and should — be maintained, like eating dinner together, celebrating holidays as a family, and going to school functions.
What's important here is letting go of the need to fix the other person. By doing so, you can find peace and work on your own growth.

Parenting marriages
Detachment is similar to a parenting marriage, in the sense that you're in the same household, but it's simply just that — a marriage based on co-parenting.
Your focus is on the kids, their needs, and managing and maintaining the home for their well-being.
A parenting marriage can also help you maintain financial security. After all, financial devastation or inequity is one of the primary reasons couples in unhappy marriages don’t divorce.
A parenting marriage also allows children to grow up with both parents without having their lives divided between two homes. As long as you and your spouse have a foundation of mutual respect, healthy communication, and united decision-making, it can work.

Living apart together marriages
There's also the Living Apart Together (LAT) Marriage.
In this case, you physically separate but live interdependently. You don’t have to divide financial assets, but you do have the additional rent or mortgage.
In a LAT marriage, you both have space to physically separate and get away from triggering behaviors. But, as with the parenting marriage, you're still contributing physical, emotional, and financial resources to a common goal.
These are just a few options to cope with an unhappy marriage without divorcing. You may not be able to fix your unhappy marriage, but you can be respectful and trustworthy, and things can work out.
Obviously, every effort should be made to save your marriage and revitalize it. One way or another, changes are going to have to be made.
Getting some professional help now can help you with that process or even with ending your unhappy marriage without divorcing.

78,The Gift I Received From My Dead Husband Changed My Life Forever,4/21/2023,Amy Sue Nathan,https://www.yourtango.com/love/gift-received-from-my-dead-husband-changed-my-life,"The shelf hung inside a deconstructed closet with no door, a built-in desk of sorts, in my dining room.

It was one of the home improvement projects finished by my ex-husband when he was still my husband. He'd built the closet into a craft station for the kids and a desk for me. Now, it housed the printer and served as a catchall. (After all, the kids were texting, not crafting. I was working on a laptop, not a bulky, lime-green desktop.)

I'd neatly lined the shelf with instruction manuals, outdated school textbooks, and classics that had been part of my kids' reading list that I swore I'd read again. The shelf was tidy, but staring at it I didn't remember the last time I'd used or moved any of it.
I removed a few books, leafed through each one longer than I'd intended, and set them on the dining room table. With the next book came a lavender envelope. It landed on the floor with an audible slap.

I picked up the envelope. There was no name or address. No stamp. It was tacked lightly shut, so someone had licked its bitter glue strip. I popped it open. But what if it wasn't for me? My house, my shelf, my envelope, right? Many scenarios popped to mind, none of them accurate.
On the outside of the card was a small, unidentifiable cartoon animal — a cutesy one. It held a sign that said, ""Sorry.""

On the inside, I was bombarded by my dead husband's handwriting.

I didn't have to look at the bottom and see the signature to know who'd written it. I'd known that penmanship since I was nineteen. I didn't need ""Dear Amy"" to know the card was, indeed, written for me. The first words were a familiar greeting.

Forgive me.

My ex died two years after we divorced. I'd forgiven his transgressions, for my own sake and for that of our children, while he was still alive and for that, I was grateful.
We had maintained a healthy distance and peculiar closeness for the kids' sake. My deductive reasoning told me this letter was written when he and I were still steeped in the charade of saving a marriage on life support.

I'll try harder.

Try harder than whom? Or what? Against what were we measuring? Had this been written before or after a thwarted attempt to try?

I liked to believe that by writing this, at that moment, he planned to ""try harder.""

In my heart, I commended the attempt. In my head, I knew that incomplete projects, whether bathroom renovations or marriages, were rarely realized if the resolution was simply ""to try.""
I want the chance to make it up to you.

Not knowing the date or impetus for this letter I had no idea if this were a request for the first chance or the last chance.

I'm sorry.

His apology went on for the length and width of the two sides of the card. It was not a confession — it was a plea.

He wrote of our long history, the future, and of wanting our family to survive. Our family did survive, although not as any of us had imagined or wanted. Our children are grown and have thrived despite their loss. Under the circumstances, I'm sure that's what he'd have wanted.
I had to wonder what happened after my ex-husband wrote this when he slipped it in between the books. Was he waiting for a special occasion to give it to me?

Maybe it was a card for my birthday. The year before my ex moved out, when we were ""working on"" our marriage, he gave me a candle for my birthday because I liked candles.

This was a big deal for us both. Admittedly, his gifts to me for almost twenty​ years were things he wanted me to have. Whether it was a bread loaf-shaped food container, a treadmill, or a sweater, he chose gifts because of the way he wanted to feel when he gave them.

He'd confessed to never considering if I'd like something. So this kind of gift-giving was new to him.
It was new to me to receive something without an agenda attached (reorganize, reduce, reinvent). He told me how he'd smelled the candles until he found a scent that said, Amy. That candle had nothing to do with him.

Perhaps the year after the candle, he'd planned to give me the card gift because he thought I wanted a written apology. But I never wanted an apology — at that time I wanted a husband. Maybe he figured that out, changed his mind, and hid the card. Or maybe his old gifting habit was hard to break, and writing the card, then hiding it, had nothing to do with me at all.

It would seem rather presumptuous, and careless, to think I'd never find the hidden card or that one of the children wouldn't find it. True, I wasn't Suzy Homemaker. True, it was likely almost a decade since he'd placed it there. But to slip this away and not retrieve it when he could have?

During the two years, my ex and I were divorced before he died, he picked up the children every Wednesday night for dinner and every other weekend. We chatted, we joked, and we sometimes argued. Had he remembered the card, I have no doubt he'd have asked to retrieve it. And I would have let him, likely without too much snooping.

What if I had found the card when he was still alive? The week or month after he'd left? After he remarried? Would he have apologized for the apology? Would I have been privy to the ultimate act of take-backsies?

Years of what-ifs fluttered by. I held the card warily as if the ink would run onto my fingers and stain my full and present life, leaving an indelible reminder of revised dreams. I'd been single for about eight years at that point. This card was a part of my past. Except it wasn't.
This letter wasn't a memento. I wasn't sure it even belonged to me. It was a mistake, a missed opportunity, or a message from beyond.

I tore it into tiny pieces, though not with malice or even much force. Then I tossed the lavender-speckled confetti into the trash can, slid the books back onto the shelf, and forgave myself for doing both.

Sincere apologies weren't my ex-husband's strong suit, but the fact that he had written such a letter at all allowed me to believe, after many years, that I hadn't completely misjudged the man I'd married so long ago.

And that was the best gift he never gave me.

79,"A Letter To My Future Love, From Your Chronically Ill Partner",4/21/2023,Allysha Snow,https://www.yourtango.com/love/letter-my-future-love-from-your-chronically-ill-partner,"Dear Future Partner,
My chronic illness journey has provided many valuable lessons over the years. Above all, I have learned about the healing power of unconditional love through family and friends.
While Im looking forward to sharing an exquisite life with you in the future, I want to be upfront about some challenges that come with dating a person who battles chronic illness.
First, I will sometimes cancel plans at the last minute. This isnt because I dont want to see you or I dont respect our important plans together. I just experience flare-ups at the most inconvenient times. The pain and fatigue will debilitate me so much that I will need to reschedule our plans.
When this happens, it will be great if you come over with a Jamba Juice and a soft hug. Maybe we can binge-watch our favorite Netflix show that evening or catch up on a podcast we both enjoy. I might ask you to throw in a load of laundry for me or give my dogs some extra love and attention.
Another important thing to know about dating me is that staying out late wont work well for my body. Because Im chronically ill, I need 8 to 10 hours of sleep nearly every night.
I love you and want to be with you, but I must fall asleep at a decent hour so that I can be the best version of myself for our relationship.
When Ive had a good nights rest, Ill be able to keep up with our activities much better. We can take nature walks, play board games, go swimming, volunteer for a cause we are passionate about, or have any number of other adventures.
At the end of those days, I cant wait to hold you in my arms and remind you how grateful I am to have such a wonderful person in my life.
Another thought: although romantic dinners out sound amazing, my food allergies make eating out at restaurants extremely difficult. I must be extremely cautious about cross-contamination because even trace amounts of allergens can make me very ill.
On the bright side, I am becoming a better cook and would love to make you dinner all the time! I will learn to cook some of your favorite dishes. We can also have nights where we prepare meals together; Ill be sure to provide music and candles for special occasions.
I am a fantastic conversationalist who loves to listen and share. I cant wait to learn more about your family, friends, work, stressors, hopes, dreams, embarrassing moments, and childhood stories.
Of course, Ill be happy to share mine with you, as well! We can talk openly about our strengths, goals, and ways to improve our relationship. I look forward to lots of pillow talk!
On the days when I experience more severe symptoms, I will be quieter than my usual self. Please dont mistake my more reserved days for a lack of interest.
Truth be told, I will likely need a kiss on the forehead and extra care on these days. I hope you can love me through it. I promise that after I recuperate from a lengthy nap, we can continue our conversations.
Lastly, you beautiful soul, I need you to understand that stress triggers many of my symptoms. I understand that stressful moments are inevitable in most relationships.
However, I have learned from experience that regular, high levels of stress are extremely detrimental because Im chronically ill. Lets please prioritize strong communication skills so that we can avoid misunderstandings.

80,"To All The Girls Looking For Love, Please Never Settle",4/19/2023,Natalie Trznadel,https://www.yourtango.com/love/to-all-girls-looking-love-please-never-settle,"In the modern world, we see relationships everywhere. From celebrity couples paparazzi photos to your friends engagement announcements on Instagram, youve definitely spotted some sort of showcase of romance.
All of these couples always look so in love. They look into each others eyes as if theres nothing but them on this planet. They post romantic quotes and profess their love for one another in long posts, affirming their perfect relationship.
Generally, most of us simply scroll through these posts without giving them a second thought. Sometimes, we may give it a ""like"" but nothing more.
But on those rare occasions when were already overwhelmed with life, these showcases of love can make us feel like were missing out on something.
Most of us have a clear idea of what we want from a significant other.
Some of us want kids and a house with a cute fence. Others want a partner whos as ambitious as they are so they can achieve their goals together. Some people even have a list with all the qualities they want in a partner, such as loyalty, communication, trust, and a good sense of humor.
But the more dates we end up going on, the less we feel like we will actually find what were looking for. So, we consider something that used to seem unimaginable to us: lowering our standards.
But Im here to tell you that settling for less than you deserve isnt the way to find love.
Yes, being single is lonely when seemingly everyone around you is in happy, loving relationships. But just because you havent found ""the one"" doesnt mean you should compromise on the most important aspects of the relationship.
Heres the thing I need everyone to know: you deserve everything you want in a romantic relationship.
If you want someone who will dance wildly while making breakfast with you, thats what you should have. If you want someone who communicates their feelings without making you feel like you should ""already know,"" you definitely deserve that. And if you want to be with someone who shares your life goals, you should never give up on that.
If you settle for something you dont deserve, you will never be happy.
To settle, you need to let go of something thats important to you. Something that youre sure you cant live without. But if you lower your expectations, that thing no longer seems to matter.
After all, youve been single for so long that you convince yourself your standards may be too high. But this couldnt be further from the truth.
Of course, there are some things you may need to compromise on in a healthy, long-term relationship. But its important to recognize the difference between compromising and lowering your standards.
Compromising means agreeing to meet your partner in the middle. Its about reaching a common ground that will help your relationship flourish. What it doesnt mean is allowing someone else to convince you that you deserve less than youre looking for.
So, to all the girls looking for love and worrying that they wont find it, dont settle.

81,What I Learned From My 3 Deepest Romantic Connections,4/17/2023," Ruth Schimel, PhD",https://www.yourtango.com/love/lessons-from-my-romances-over-decades,"I never appreciated how much I could learn from my failures. None of the insights from expensive, time-consuming therapy, discomfort, pain or suffering provided actionable answers.
Instead, I made progress when I was honest with myself about my choices with three major failed romances.
Then, I eventually saw the patterns and underlying ambivalent motivation I had, instead of blaming the seemingly disparate guys.
The power  and empowerment  of romantic experience
The great advantage of such personal insight was that my efforts resulted in making freer, more informed choices for myself. In contrast, trying to find external explanations takes time and power away  just as looking for sources of happiness and success outside oneself distracts from authentic choices.
This focus on personal insight is not meant to shift the blame to oneself. Better, it avoids the lost time and illusions of trying to change others behavior or find a perfect match.  Both could be endless or impossible; people, situations and their interactions are dynamic. Looking within also saves wasted energy on detours, mistakes and unrealistic hopes.
Given an open mind and curiosity, finding the blocking themes, in retrospect especially, is not so hard. Timing and readiness also contribute to well-chosen outcomes.  
Unfortunately, I developed these insights later than was immediately useful. But maybe they will contribute to your own effective choices.
First love  senior year of college
At the time, I had no idea I was suffering from watered-down stages of infatuation, crystallization and deterioration. 
Nusret was a visiting Turkish Ph.D. post-graduate student four years my senior. We were part of a small, tight social group within our smaller college of Cornell ILR, including labor union organizers studying on loan for a year as well as foreign and American students.  
This propinquity and shared interests strengthened the appeal of exoticism of differences in ages and backgrounds. The first excitement of physical exploration also provided bonding that passed for intimacy with Nusret.
Over the year, I hatched a nave plan to join the Foreign Service and get stationed in Turkey. To save money for an early visit to him and his family, I would live with my parents and work in New York City. Over that year I taught myself some basic Turkish, learning proper pronunciations and using English associations. For example, tel meant wire.  
I will spare you the details of getting there on a Greek freighter docking in Naples to visit with Italian family friends in the area. The closer I got to Turkey, the less I heard from Nusret. Only two days before departing I received his confirming letter.
No wonder I had not heard from him. He lived in a basic apartment with his mentally ill mother and sweet sister in a small town outside Istanbul. No running water, bedbugs, squatting toilet  you get the idea. Yet, I had warm, welcoming experiences getting to know Turkey and other Turks as we visited nearby locales and traveled around the hinterlands.   
But when the paperwork to take the test in Ankara did not arrive, my resourceful, intrepid mother intervened, wrestling it from the State Department in time. 
I passed that test and the oral one about a year later at the United Nations in New York. By then, experiences with the realities of Nursets values, veracity and way of life led to the deterioration stage of limerence. I had returned home from Turkey, knowing the relationship was over.
Lingering with an unexpected man
Back in the United States after two foreign assignments in Quito, Ecuador and Calcutta, India, I met Richard at a classy Georgetown party. Staring at me as I walked somewhat late into the main room was this short, dark man leaning cockily against the fireplace mantel. What an arrogant guy, I remember thinking.
And what place was left to sit after I helped myself to food? Next to Richard! We fell easily into what I call erotic conversation: stimulating eclectic content, flowing with intensity but not sexual. Next, we moved to an engaging piano bar. Typical of Richards boldness, he then said, My place or yours? Propriety won at my place.  
His emotional inaccessibility and our on-and-off relationship bumped along for years. It continued to rekindle, in part by our far-ranging but overlapping interests, his as a journalist and mine as a diplomat, eight years younger.
The relationship eventually petered out, due in part due to my hesitancy to discuss and confront lingering issues and his avoidance. Nothing of deep, sustainable meaning could develop from such interesting yet inconclusive tendencies, but I had engaging times meeting his famous friends and stimulating excursions mostly through matters of the mind.  
Almost a conventional connection
Finally, there was Allen, four years younger. We got as far as literal engagement v. actual attention to many real issues ranging from differences in the background to his annoyance with my talking to dogs on the street.  
They broke whatever bridges existed from our common profession and the rubber band tensions of often appealing yet inconsistent togetherness. One of my best, lingering memories was skinny dipping in a posh pool where he was house-sitting. That occurred when I had let go of expectations of commitment after too many on-and-offs, including an iffy engagement. 
Playing was then free and uncomplicated by expectations. To free us both, I finally encouraged Allen to make a true commitment to another woman we both knew whom he eventually married.  
My first impression of Allen was confirmed when I met him during our early morning assignments preparing briefing materials for the Secretary of State. What a twerp, I thought at the time, not realizing that he looked something like my father until I noticed some resemblance in photos I had taken. 
What did each of these anecdotes of romance have in common? It was difficult to see it as it happened, but obvious in retrospect: 
	Curiosity about and experiences with exotic, different, smart generally older men
	Excitement with dramas, stimulating explorations and juicy conversations
	Tendency to stay way too long with unpromising situations, in part due to sunk costs, comfort even with the established ups and downs and possibly my stubbornness about letting to
	Lack of attention to and imagination beyond relationship dynamics to elicit themes for learning, avoid questionable matches and note symptomatic problems
	Focus on the limitations of the men, rather than patterns of underlying motivation, choices and behavior
How imprints of earlier relationships shaped later romantic choices
Though I wonder about genetic predispositions, I believe most of us are imprinted by significant early experiences with people and situations. I was imprinted and left wanting by unfinished business with three older, smart capable and naturally flawed (as we all are) men. They were my father (I was born when he was 40), my dark Uncle Dick and my short, dark and fascinating high school English teacher. The latter two were all named Richard!
In part due to generational differences and norms of behavior, as I was growing up, it was not until we were both much older that I was able to engage my father in a frank and comfortable conversation. He mostly chose the teacher role with me.  
Poignant and irreversible that so much time was wasted until we had been able to connect as individuals. Yet, I treasure the few adult conversations we had before he died, often prompted when I asked him personal questions.
Let experience guide your decisions
Similarly, at the end of my intellectually deepening learning connection with my English teacher, I mustered the courage to insist on a meaningful comment in my yearbook instead of his first, Good luck.  Perhaps scarfed up from his other writing, he wrote this: Quiet fire, hot flame, a mind of light and permanent warmth.
I did not confront journalist Richard (another writer) until the coda when I had him captive as he drove me home from his then home on Marylands eastern shore.  
I wonder what would have happened if I spoke my mind and heart earlier in these relationships. Perhaps improvements and greater authenticity, but more likely earlier or better endings with less wasted time.
Bottom line: Listen to initial intuitions about significant relationships and have honest conversations with oneself as early as possible. For example, why did I continue to choose such unlikely men? Not just habit and imprinting. Maybe I didnt want a conventional relationship, even marriage.

82,Ngomongin Cinta? Ini Opini!,3/19/2018,Hebbie Agus Kurnia,https://medium.com/no-drama/ngomongin-cinta-ini-opini-21d84eb5b93e,"Mencintai bukan cuma soal hati. Mencintai juga soal akal.
Ibarat beli rumah, lo engga bisa cuma liat dalemnya rumah itu aja.
Waaah bagus rumahnya, ruangannya, wcnya nyaman.
Percuma kalau rumah dalemnya bagus, tapi samping kanan kirinya kuburan, jurang, pembuangan sampah. Apa lo akan nyaman setelah tau keadaan rumah sekitar? Nyaman? Pilihan.
Begitu juga cinta.
Engga bisa cuma liat tampilan, engga bisa cuma liat perjuangannya membuat lo nyaman. Percayalah, bisa jadi itu kamuflase.
Cinta pandangan pertama? Really? Nafsu pandangan pertama? Maybe.
Saat seseorang ingin sesuatu, lo harus inget kalo itu bisa jadi dua hal : Cuma Reaksi atau Setulus Hati.
Cara taunya? Kritis sama diri lo sendiri. Be skeptical. Tenang. Jangan manjain perasaan. Pertanyakan banyak hal. Hargai proses.
Bukan.
Bukan mencari sosok yang sempurna. Karena itu engga akan pernah lo dapetin. Sampe kapanpun.
Ada dua jenis kekurangan : kekurangan yang bisa diterima dengan hati lapang, ada yang memang dasarnya engga bisa diterima. Masalah cocok atau dicocok-cocokin, itu beda.
Cocok ya karena lo emang nyaman dengan karakter, tempramental dan kepribadian dia. Lo bisa terima lapang dada. Itu.
Dicocok-cocokin, ini beda lagi. Sebenernya ada yang engga lo sreg, yang bikin lo suffer almost everyday, tapi lo tetep bertahan.
Okay, mungkin karena rasa percaya dan hati lo yang bilang lo harus bertahan dan berharap dia akan berubah. Fine.
Tapi kalo sampe harga diri lo udah direnggut, main tangan, dicampakin, diselingkuhin, apa itu masih bikin lo tetep bertahan? Masih? Well, go on, then. Good luck!
Atau karena takut ngelepas karena engga ada lagi seganteng dia? Secantik dia? F*ck off saat lo menua juga fisik akan berubah.
Berpikir long term. Jangan bangga sama hal-hal short term.
Ini semua konspirasi dari akal dan hati lo dalam memahami seseorang. Ini tentang kesadaran diri lo.
Ini tentang gimana lo nerima kekurangan yang bener-bener bisa lo terima. Bukan kekurangan yang bikin lo jadi menderita. Gausah munafik, kita hidup untuk ibadah dengan happy. Jadi, berdamailah dengan kekurangan yang bisa lo terima.
Jadi, disini lo butuh banyak sudut pandang tentang seseorang. Wawasan.
Ada lagi.
Tanggung jawab, keseriusan, sampai kemauan untuk bisa bertahan ditengah kesulitan hidup, patut lo perhitungkan!
Dan yang terakhir, rencana Allah yang paling banyak nentuin. Tapi bukan berarti semua udah ada ketentuannya, terus lo terima gitu aja tanpa ada usaha.
Pasrah itu hadir saat berusaha dan setelah berusaha. Bukan belum ngapa-ngapain udah pasrah. Lo manusia, bukan hewan.
Ikhtiar duniawi, yes. Ikhtiar ukhrawi, yes.
Bahkan Doa yang paling sering lo panjatkan pun, mintanya dunia dan akhirat.
Dan kalo lo cowok yang lagi baca ini. Gue mau sampein satu hal.
Tunjukin keseriusan + arah kemana hubungan yang akan lo bawa nanti berlabuh. Kalo cuma hadir untuk main-main, cuma hadir untuk membangun kesenangan semu, lebih baik gausah deket sama sekali. Clarity.
Engga semua cewek mau sama yang kaya, ganteng, pengusaha, karyawan top, bukan.
Kepastian dan rasa melindungi yang kuat akan banyak berbicara nantinya.
Visi kedepan nanti, yang digabung sama konsistensi + mental tahan banting, yang bikin lo (cowok) jadi someone.
Kenapa tulisan ini hadir?
Tahun 2013 lalu menurut Kementerian Agama, tingkat perceraian di Indonesia dalam rasio adalah 1 : 8. Artinya, setiap 8 keluarga yang menikah, ada 1 keluarga yang akan bercerai.
Tapi di tahun 2017 ternyata meningkat rasionya. 1 : 5. Artinya, setiap 5 keluarga yang menikah ada 1 keluarga yang akan bercerai. Kenapa?
Menurut gue, beberapa pasangan menikah masih belum paham tujuannya apa. Mereka ketutup sama kebahagiaan semu. 13 bulan mungkin seneng, tapi dalam jangka panjang mereka engga terlalu memikirkan kesana.
Kedua, saran gue jangan gampang dikomporin untuk nikah muda. Menikahlah saat lo merasa dewasa, bukan muda.
Apa dewasa yang gue maksud?
Ada rasa tanggung jawab dan kemampuan untuk mengayomi. Harta dan ilmu ini berperan penting. Bukan salah satunya, tapi keduanya. Emang rezeki mah ada aja. Tapi jangan memahami keyakinan rezeki mah ada aja dengan cara pasrah yang salah. Pasrah yang engga dibarengi ilmu. Pasrah yang keliru.
Tanggung jawab. Kerja keras. Memahami. Komitmen.
Gue bukan praktisi, tapi kayaknya bentar lagi jadi praktisi #eh. Moga ini jadi pengingat.
Karena buat gue,
Cinta adalah sarana untuk sama-sama bertumbuh lebih baik. Didalamnya terdapat hikmah kehidupan. Engga cuma nafsu.

83,Surat Cinta,1/28/2017,Anggit Yuniar Pradito,https://medium.com/@anggit_pradito/surat-cinta-48912838b4c8,"Anda pernah menulisnya?
Saya pernah. :)
Surat ini saya tulis akhir tahun 2013, sewaktu saya kuliah di Institut Seni Indonesia Yogyakarta. Sebagai materi tugas kuliah, lupa mata kuliah apa, yang jelas dosennya bapak Sumbo Tinarbuko. Saya masih ingat, mengumpulkan tugas dengan amplop bergambarkan hati di tengahnya. Tugasnya menulis peran dan pentingnya Desain Komunikasi Visual dalam kehidupan manusia. Entah mengapa, saya justru menulis surat cinta. Keluar begitu saja, mengalir apa adanya. Melankolis? mungkin. Sok romantis? Bisa jadi.
Saya menulis surat cinta untuk anak saya. Lebih tepatnya untuk calon anak saya di masa depan kelak. Saya masih single tentunya, meski pada saat menulis sedang punya pacar. :)
Begini suratnya,
Assalamualaikum Warohmatulloh Wabarokatuh
Nak, mungkin saat membaca surat ini dirimu telah menjadi seorang desainer hebat. Bapak yakin kemampuan mendesainmu sangat mumpuni. Tapi perkenankan sedikit Bapak bercerita tentang hidup dan DKV. Sebagai desainer, kita harus bisa hidup dan belajar hidup dari DKV ,Nak Tak hanya bisa menjadi dunia yang bisa menghidupi kita, kita sebenarnya bisa belajar banyak dari desain (ketauilah Nak, zaman Bapak desain belum dihargai seperti zamanmu). Desain itu sama seperti ilmu hidup, kamu bisa belajar dari setiap bagiannya. Ambilah pelajaran dari kehidupan desain yang kamu jalani.
Anakku, kamu pasti tahu SWOT kan, Nak? Ya, Strength Weakness Opportunity Threats, meski mungkin sekarang sudah tidak dipakai lagi. Tak hanya untuk desain, tapi kenalilah dirimu dengan analisa SWOT, Nak. Pahami dirimu, siapa kamu. Apa kelemahanmu, apa kelebihanmu, lakukan instropeksi diri. Siapa yang mengenal dirinya, dia akan mengenal Tuhannya, Nak. Kenali dirimu seutuhnya. Gunakan untuk meningkatkan kualitas pribadimu, rajin-rajinlah melihat diri sebelum melihat orang lain.
Setiap mendesain tak lepas dari Target Audience kan, Nak? Kalau kamu jago menganalisa target audience desainmu, kamu harus pintar menganalisa target audience dalam hidupmu, Nak. Pandai-pandailah menyesuaikan diri. Ojo keminter, ojo mbodhoni. Sesuaikan dengan siapa kamu berhadapan, Tak perlu pingin terlihat pintar, bicaralah seperlunya, sesuaikan takarannya. Kamu harus pandai menempatkan diri, dimanapun kamu berada. Bersikaplah sewajarnya, sederhana tapi bermakna.
Hargailah proses dalam hidup, Nak. Seperti kamu melalui tahapan dalam mendesain. Karyamu yang hebat pasti melalui tahap brainstorm, lay out kasar, lay out halus, baru sampai final artwork. Jangan tergesa-gesa, Nak. Nikmati prosesnya, sabar dan tunggulah waktu yang tepat untuk bertindak. Selalu pilih yang terbaik di setiap kesempatan, tentu setelah kamu memahami semua yang ada. Kamu harus memikirkinkan semua kemungkinan yang terjadi, baru kemudian merumuskan yang terbaik yang mana. Hidup itu perjuangan, Nak. Belajarlah dari orang-orang sukses, merekapun pasti pernah susah. Namun, mereka tidak berputus asa menghadapi semua ujian. Belajarlah dari mereka.
Kamu pasti tahu branding kan, Nak? Bapak tak setuju teori Pak Subiakto, Brand = promise. Bapak setuju teorinya Sakti Makki,
Brand = You!
Berbuat baiklah karena kamu benar-benar baik, berbuat baik karena kewajiban. Bukan berbuat baik karena ingin dilihat baik. Kalau berbuat baik, buatlah seutuhnya. Tak perlu berpura-pura dalam hidup, Nak! Be You, Son!
Tak perlu bersifat komsumtif, karena iklan itu pembohong besar, Nak! Jangan percaya iklan, karena pembuatnya dibayar untuk membuat setan di otakmu, membuat keinginan jadi kebutuhan. Dia menciptakan kebutuhan-kebutuhan semu di matamu. Desainer juga harus belajar ilmu keuangan, biar pandai mengatur uang. Yang terpenting, jangan terperdaya iklan! Pintarlah membedakan kebutuhan dengan keinginan. Always trust your hearth! Kamu harus belajar dari tipografi, Nak. Pelajarilah perannya dalam menyampaikan pesan. Kamu pasti pernah dengar,
Without type, design like fine art.
Kamu harus bisa membantu orang lain, menyampaikan pesan kebenaran dengan tindakanmu. Migunani tumrap liyan. Jadilah orang yang berguna untuk sesama. Bantu temanmu yang kesusahan, siapapun. Jadilah seperti huruf, menyampaikan pesan ke siapa saja, Nak!
Pahami juga packaging, Nak. Meski terlihat sepele, besar perannya, Nak. Tak hanya melindungi isi, packaging harus mempunyai nilai estetis dan representasi isinya. Belajarlah dari dia, berbusanalah yang baik, Nak. Jangan lupa,
Ajining diri ono ing kedhaling lathi, ajining sariro ono ing kedhaling busono.
Hormatilah orang lain dengan berbusana yang baik. Kalau kamu tak menghormati dirimu, bagaimana orang lain menghormatimu. Tebarlah senyum kepada orang dengan eloknya busanamu. Tak harus dengan barang branded, seorang desainer harus mampu meramu biar indah. Gunakan semua teori dalam desain. Use your taste, Son!
Jangan lupa belajar nirmana, Nak. Karena nirmana merupakan dasar desain. Kamu pasti akan menciptakan good design jika paham nirmana. Hidup juga seperti itu, Nak. Hidup juga perlu agama sebagai dasar. Jika kamu beragama dengan benar, pasti hidupmu akan indah. Baca dan pelajarilah Al Quran dan sunnah Kanjeng Nabi Muhammad SAW, pasti hidupmu nikmat, Nak. Yang terakhir, teruslah belajar dan membaca dalam hidup. Dari siapa dan dari mana saja. Hargai budaya bangsamu.
Wassalamualaikum Warohmatulloh Wabarokatuh
Kanthi tresno,
Bapak.
Begitu,
Surat ini menjadi bagian dari sejarah hidup saya. Tolong mention anak saya kelak. Ibunya siapa? Eaa
Bukannya meniru Mark Zuckerberg yang menulis surat untuk Max, anaknya. Saya lebih dahulu menulisnya. Meskipun saya bukan siapa-siapa dibanding Mark, paling tidak ini warisan saya nantinya.

Serta tidak tahu mengapa tiap-tiap artikel dgn topik di atas kerapkali saya baca :D
Dibumbui dengan 1/2 sendok makan pengalaman pribadi di campur dengan satu sendok makan pengetahuan dari beberapa artikel, jadilah artikel ini. Semoga akhirnya lezat. Hehe *jokes
So, jadi apakah sich yg tuturnya Relationship Goals? Di tempat ini saya cuma share, serta ini Relationship Goals menurut saya sendiri. Semasing dari kita pastinya punyai masukan yg berlainan kan, jadi saya tidak punya tujuan buat pengaruhi pemikiran anda sekalipun.
Banyak anak remaja yg style pacarannya wah menurut saya, dengan posting di social media serta menamakannya Relationship Goals. Tetapi buat saya sendiri Relationship Goals bukan terus-terusan masalah kebersamaan, photo berdua and something else, but Relationship Goals is:
	Goals, Apakah arah kalian kala hendak memutuskan untuk berpacaran. Ya pastilah arah untuk menjurus yg lebih yg serius (baca, menikah).
	Commitment, lantaran relationship ini dibikin oleh dua orang yg pastilah mempunya jalan pikiran yg tidak sama, you both should have commitment. Commitment seperti apakah? Commitment untuk sama-sama mengontrol interaksi, dengan mengingat apakah sich arah kalian kala awal pacaran. (Poin 1)
Poin ini sangatlah penting, lantaran bila cuma salah satunya pihak saja yg miliki commitment itu, interaksi dapat susah dibikin and not balance.
	Trusting, yakin dapat apa pun perihal yg dilakuin ia tak perlu mencurigai serta memberi banyak bertanya yg cuman membuat pusing.
Love Is Not About Covenience, Its About Commitment (Mr. Amari Soul)
Dengan versi yg lebih sederhana.
	Sama sama terbuka, yg pabila ada soal atau ada yg tak disuka dr pembawaan masing2 pasangan, ya ngomong. Jujur ada soal apakah, jgn dipendem sendirian yg ujung2nya justru membuat interaksi renggang. Terkecuali pacar kalian dukun yg dapat ketahui apakah saja meski kalian diem. (yakali -_-)
	Jangan sampai gengsi untuk blg im Sorry. Ayolah, utk satu Relationship Goals musti miliki pemikiran yg dewasa. Jika mmg salah jgn sempat gengsi utk meminta maaf, serta berikan ia kalau kamu akan melakukan perbaikan utk selanjutnya. disana kedewasaan diri telihat.
	Hargai ia and saying ThankYou for everything her/his do for your life.
	Yg tak sempat textin or callin everyday. Kembali ngapain? Sudah makan blm?, nyokap kalian saja tak segitunya.
	Yg ngga over thinking and posesif keterlaluan, yg pabila pergi sll berprasangka buruk serta nanya, pergi sama siapa?, pergi kemana?, jangan sampai itu serta jgn itu. Baru pacaran sudah berikut, bagaimana pabila sudah nikah? Dapat stress yg ada -_-
	Tak sempat mengumbar2 di medsos pabila lg ada soal. Alay.
Tetep ngehargain serta dapat kasih ruang ke kita untuk Family time, me time or friends time. Sebab hidup lantas tak mesti selalu saja ttg ia.
	Selamanya dapat dibawa berbagi ttg perihal apa pun, Tak menyombongkan diri kala kasih input, tak yg sangat terasa benar and still okay even if different opinions.
	Yg dapat selamanya yakin serta dukungan perihal baik apa pun yg kita laksanakan.
	Yang pasti dapat bawa pula kita menuju yg lebih baik kembali, satu diantaranya poin penting. Sebab pabila dr awal pacaran kita sudah ngerasa kok berikut ya?, serta ia tak dapat bawa pula kita lebih baik kembali atau justru demikian sebaliknya, you should END your relationship. :)

85,Pacaran Mengajariku 5 Hal Mengenai Toleransi,7/4/2020,Viko Anugrah,https://medium.com/@vikoanugrah/5-hal-mengenai-toleransi-yang-aku-pelajari-pada-saat-berpacaran-20dc8ad420c,"Dalam bayangan kolektif kita, pacaran itu selalu dianggap sekedar cinta-cintaan, main-main, dan bahkan nafsu-nafsuan. Cinta dan pacaran itu selalu dianggap sebagai hal yang trivial dan jelas kalah oleh disksursus mayoritas dan maha dewasa, yaitu pernikahan. Tapi, kita bisa memanfaatkan pacaran untuk belajar hal-hal dasar yang penting, salah satunya adalah menghormati perbedaan.
#1. Sadar bahwa kita berdua adalah orang yang berbeda.
Hal pertama yang aku sadari adalah bahwa walau kita serasa sebagai belahan hati, sebenarnya kita hanyalah dua individu yang berbeda. Perbedaan ini spektrum ya luas, bisa mulai dari perbedaan selera hewan peliharaan sampai agama dan prinsip-prinsip dasar lainnya.
Aku dulu berpandangan bahwa pacaran itu bersatu = harus banyak kesamaan dan kecocokan. Tapi, selama bisa ditolerir, aku merasa tidak perlu mengambil jalur evangelis.
#2. Tahu kapan harus mundur.
Dalam diskusi, kadang-kadang perbedaan pendapat pasangan bisa membuat emosi negatif membuncah. Emosi negatif ini bisa membuat kita memotong argumen pasangan, marah, dan sebagainya yang berpotensi membuat hubungan kita tidak sehat. Menjaga pasangan itu lebih berharga daripada memenangkan argumen. Jadi kenapa tidak didengarkan saja dulu?
#3. Memahami argumen dan menempatkan dirimu di posisi pasangan.
Sekarang kamu sudah mendengarkan argumen pasanganmu, terus? Ya cobalah gali dan pahami alasan dia berkeyakinan seperti itu. Selain membuat pasanganmu merasa nyaman berdiskusi dengan kamu, itung-itung bisa mengenal dia lebih jauh.
#4. Perbedaan pendapat tidak membuat kita sebagai musuh.
Kecuali, jika perbedaan pendapat berkaitan dengan isu yang benar-benar sensitif dan tidak bisa ada kompromi. Tapi, jika masih bisa kompromi dan termasuk isu-isu yang agak jauh dari pribadi kita, ya wallahualam. Lagian, seringkali orang hanya meyakini sesuatu tanpa pernah dan enggan untuk mengamalkannya.
#5. Mengubah pendapat orang lain tidak harus melalui makian.
Dalam beberapa kasus aku dan pasanganku memiliki momen-momen pada saat yang satu mengubah pandangan yang lain. No makian dan hinaan, no berantem, just plain revelation.
#6. Minta maaf kalau salah dan own your mistakes.
Setiap setelah berantem aku dan pasangan selalu reflect dan minta maaf dengan sungguh-sungguh sebagai pihak yang salah disertai rencana untuk make amends.

86,"3 Reasons You're Still Single, And What To Do About It",1/25/2023,Sabrina Bendory,https://thoughtcatalog.com/sabrina-bendory/2023/01/3-reasons-youre-still-single-and-what-to-do-about-it-right-now/,"Every single girl will at some point find herself asking this question: is there no one out there for me or am I the problem?
Being single is not a curse (in fact, there are some very lovely perks to living the single life), but it isnt exactly something people aspire to. There are times when we need to be singleand its very admirable when you can acknowledge that and ignore the pressure to settle downand then there are times when you realize that you are ready to meet that special someone and settle downyou just dont know how to make it happen. Maybe the guys you date are duds. Maybe guys pull the disappearing act on you over and over. Maybe your relationships always implode.
To solve a problem, you need to correctly identify it. Here are the top three (most likely) reasons you are still single:
1. Youre Too Needy.
Theres no faster way to repel a man than to need him. Wanting a man is not the same as needing one.
Neediness is a state of mind where you feel incomplete, or have an emotional void, and try to fill this empty space with a relationship or male validation. A lot of women mistake the male aversion to neediness as men being commitment-phobes. This isnt true. A man will happily enter into a relationship with a woman who sees and appreciates him for exactly who he is. Conversely, a man will run far away from a woman who sees him as an opportunity to feel good about herself or fill some void.
A guy wants to feel chosen by a woman he had to earn. He doesnt want to feel like hes just filling a slot that could have easily gone to any other male with a pulse.
Solution: Neediness usually stems from a lack of self-esteem or sense of worth. You feel like something is missing within yourself or in your life and erroneously believe a relationship will be the cure. If you were unhappy before the relationship, youll be unhappy in it. Instead of feeling sorry for yourself about being single, work on your relationship with yourself. Work on feeling your best and looking your best. When you are the best you that you can be, you wont be able to keep the men away!
2. Youre Too Picky.
Most women are usually at one extreme or the other: desperate and willing to put up with anything, or too picky and unwilling to settle for anything less than her dream man.
In this day and age, were saturated with unrealistic love sagas and have developed an idea of what love should be and not of what love is. Were told love conquers all but in truth, love alone does not make for a good, and healthy relationship (I mean, just about every divorced couple loved each other at some point). We want to be swept off our feet and taken over by this all-consuming feeling of euphoria and harmony. If were not feeling the intensity on the first date, well write the guy off and say there was no spark.
Another problem is that most women have adopted this idea that its better to be alone than settle. As a result, they close themselves off to guys with amazing potential just because of some superficial flaw that rules him out as her dream guy. The longer youre single, the worse this can get because you might start telling yourself, Well Ive waited this long to find the one, I am not compromising on anything and should get exactly what I want!
Its okay to have standards and to have an idea of the kind of guy you want to be with, but its also important to be a little flexible and realize that you might not get every single thing you want and that doesnt mean youre settling.
Maybe you dont like his job, maybe you dont like the way he dresses, maybe you think his hobbies are lame. This all might be true, but its important to realize that these things dont tell you who he is, and who he is might be a really wonderful, kind, caring person.
Solution: Make a list of non-negotiable qualities a husband should have. This does not include things like how far back his hairline is or how much money he makes. Money wont make for a happy marriage, neither will a full head of hair, a chiseled jaw, or six pack abs. Obviously you want to be attracted to your husband, but try not to get so caught up on the physical details.
Next, when you go out with a guy and dont feel that all-consuming spark, dont write him off. Unless there was something that absolutely repulsed you about him, give him another shot. A lot of women are way too quick to dismiss a guy before really giving him a fair shot. I know more stories than I can even count of women who went on a few meh dates with the man they eventually marries. Who knows where they would have ended up had they not given the guys another shot.
3. You Have A Faulty Filter System.
A bad filter system sets you up for failure because your relationship has a chance to get off the ground, if you even get that far.
Everyone has a certain ingrained filter system. This system is partially due to genetic wiring, but it is largely shaped by our experiences. This filter system is often based on our interests, desires, and our fears. For instance, if you are afraid of rejection, all youll pick up on is being rejected. A hundred people can tell you how great an wonderful you are, but it wont sink in. All that will stand out to you is the one person who didnt seem to be interested in you.
Your reality is created in large part by your filter system. If you believe that the guys you want will never want you, you will find a justification for this fear even if its far from the case. Once you come to expect the behavior, you create a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Whether consciously or not, you will start to behave in a way that turns men off (this can be very subtle and might not come across in anything you say or do), thus feeding into your original fear. If you are afraid your boyfriend will never commit in the way you want him to, you will ignore all signs of his commitment and will only focus on the signs that he doesnt want to commit.
We have an innate need to justify our thought patterns, even if these patterns dont serve us in a positive way.
Want proof? Close your eyes and pick a color. Visualize the color in your mind, picture items that are that color, see yourself dressed in that color, think about the emotions that color evokes. Spend about 30 seconds to a minute doing this and then open your eyes, whats the first thing you saw? I guarantee it will be that color unless you did this in an all white room. If we dwell on something, even for under a minute, our mind becomes programmed to pick it up.
Were all wired to look at the world in subjective ways. Reality is not objective; it is shaped by both what happens to us and how we interpret the things that happen to us.
Solution: In order to have more success in love and relationships, you need to adjust your filter system so that you see the good all around you. You need to be able to appreciate and acknowledge the goodness that is in you and in your relationship. If you let your fears run the show, you will set yourself up for sabotage.",Percintaan
87,Still Love Your Ex? Here Are Six Steps To Help You Move On,5/14/2023,Sabrina Bendory,https://thoughtcatalog.com/sabrina-bendory/2023/05/moving-on-from-your-ex/,"Nothing can hinder your future happiness like staying stuck in the past. This goes for every aspect of your life but is especially true of relationships. Happy relationships are ones you can grow in, feel natural in, and be your best self in, and you cant do any of those things if youre stuck in a rut. You cant live your best life in the here and now if youre still struggling to come to terms with what happened before.
They say its better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all, and thats true. But that doesnt provide a complete picture; its even better to have loved and lost and learned the lessons about why, grown from them, and moved on, than to have loved and lost and stayed obsessed with the other person and what went wrong. It hurts, theres no way around it. How can you move on? Its true that time heals, but its not a passive process, its an active one. You need to put in some work before you can really move on, but in time you will and youll be even better than before.
How do you actively go about healing? Here are 6 steps to help the moving-on process.
How to Move On When You Still Love Your Ex
1. Follow the no contact rule
You must cut off all contact. It doesnt matter how badly you want to hear his voice, or that you want to wish him happy birthday or good luck with the interview, or have a closure talk for the 50th timeno contact.
Do this for at least a month. Its very important that you dont spend that month obsessing over him. Spend it focusing on yourself and actively trying to move on and find happiness on your own. Spend time with friends and family, take a mini-vacation, get yourself to the gym. Dive into self-help, take a class. Dont stalk him on social media or try to find ways to run into him. No contact means no contact, online or off.
If he contacts you, kindly tell him once that you need some time alone and to please not interfere with that. Ignore any future attempts of his to contact you, as any contact will just hinder the moving-on process.
Dont try to be friends or anything like that, at least not now. That can only happen once youre completely over him. Contact with him when your heart is still breaking is just setting yourself up to set yourself back.
Maybe hell be back in your life someday, maybe not. Dont focus on that now. Focus on you.
2. Look back realistically
Part of the reason its so hard to move on is were mourning the loss of potentialwhat could have been, not what actually was. This isnt about the actual person or relationship, its about what we hoped for. A breakup is like a death because its the death of this potential.
Dont try to be friends or anything like that, at least not now. That can only happen once youre completely over him. Contact with him when your heart is still breaking is just setting yourself up to set yourself back.
Maybe hell be back in your life someday, maybe not. Dont focus on that now. Focus on you.
2. Look back realistically
Part of the reason its so hard to move on is were mourning the loss of potentialwhat could have been, not what actually was. This isnt about the actual person or relationship, its about what we hoped for. A breakup is like a death because its the death of this potential.
If you keep saying to yourself Everything was perfect but x, the bottom line is everything was not perfect. It wasnt and never could have been everything you hoped for.
3. Feel your feelings
Feelings dont go away just because they go unacknowledged.
Deal with your anger, your grief, your sadness. Write out all the things left unsaid, all the feelings unexpressed. If you dont get them out theyll just continue cycling through you, throughout your entire being, blocking any chance at healing.
Give yourself a limit on the grieving, though. Allow yourself to feel your feelings, address them and acknowledge them, but dont drag this process out forever. Life needs to go on. Give yourself maybe a week or two, then pick yourself up and move along.
Writing letters you dont send can help get out all the feelings, maybe youll even discover some feelings you hadnt known you had.
4. Try to forgive.
Maybe he didnt apologize, it doesnt matter. Forgive him anyway. Its not about him, its about you. Forgiveness is freeing. Holding onto anger just poisons you.
Forgiving him doesnt mean approving of anything he did or believing hes a good person. Try to remember that most people dont do things with purely evil intentions. Maybe he did something terrible, or maybe he didnt treat you right, but realize that it probably wasnt his intention.
See things from his perspective if you can and maybe even practice some empathy. Consider that he might have had a rough upbringing and might not be capable of love and commitment, and thats incredibly sad for him. This doesnt excuse any of his behavior or change the fact that hes not right for you, but it can give you some perspective that will help you move on.
Most importantly, know that his behavior has nothing to do with you or your worthiness. How he treated you is a reflection of his own character, not your worthiness. How he felt about you is a reflection of what was going on with him and what he needs because of who he is, not a statement about who you are as a person.
You dont need to tell him you forgive him (remember the no contact rule!) this can and should be a purely internal thing. You need to turn your focus inward, to caring for your own well-being. Dont worry about whats going on with him, its not your concern.
5. What can I learn from this?
There is always a lesson to learn  and when you can learn the lessons, youll come out better in the end.
You must have learned something heresomething about yourself, something about love, something about being in a relationshiptry to extract whatever you can and use it to be even better. If life is about anything, its about learning.
Dont ever see it as a waste of time, see it as time spent learning lessons you needed to learn. Love is never wasted. If you can learn from the experience, youll bring what you learned into your next relationship and into your life overall.
6. Focus on self-love.
Forgive yourself for any mistakes you may have made. Its human to make mistakes. Nobody is perfect and its not possible to go back and do it all again. The only thing you can do is learn and move on.
Realize you deserve someone who wants the kind of relationship you want, someone who treats you well, someone who loves you just as much as you love him. If you feel unworthy then get help to uncover why that is, whether thats by seeing a therapist or researching self-help books until you find one or two that speak to you. What makes you think you dont deserve the things you want? Figure it out.
Rebuild the most important relationship of allthe one you have with yourself. Try new things, spend time with people you care about, travel, do things that make you feel inspired and alive.
Final Thoughts
We know that love is not enough, but when our hearts are breaking that knowledge doesnt help us heal. You know you werent right for each otherthe fact that you broke up is the ultimate sign of that. But you can love someone even when hes not right for you, and how do you move on when you still love him?
These 6 steps really boil down to one thingtaking care of yourself. If you cant care for yourself, you cant care for someone else and you cant have a happy relationship. Focus on you. Recognize that your own value is independent of anyones opinion of you. Know that you deserve to be happy. When you really get this, deep down, love will come.",Percintaan
88,He Says He Needs Space— Here’s What To Do,5/2/2023,Sabrina Bendory,https://thoughtcatalog.com/sabrina-bendory/2023/05/he-says-he-needs-space-heres-what-to-do/,"Few things are as frightening or nerve-wracking as a man needing space. Maybe he comes right out and tells you he needs some space, or maybe you notice hes backing away  you havent seen him in a while, his texts or calls are shorter and less frequent, and you can just feel it in your gut that something is amiss.
If you ask him whats going on and why hes being this way, he might come right out and say he needs some space (which does nothing to assuage your mounting anxiety), or he might say something to indicate it in an indirect way, like he needs to focus on work right now, or hes really stressed, or he thinks you should be spending some time focusing on yourself. Even worse, he may pretend like everything is totally normal, making you feel crazy, even though you know youre not crazy and something is just not right here!

A man might ask for space in the beginning of a relationship, or when things are more serious, or even after youre married. No matter what, its a horrible feeling and you cant stop your mind from spinning and fearing the worst. You try to figure out what you could have done wrong, and you strategize about ways to make things better and get the relationship back on track. This usually doesnt work; if anything it makes the situation even worse.
Heres the thing thats important to realize: men are not women. The way they process and experience things is different. Taking space is a natural coping mechanism for most men, just as seeking out support from friends and loved ones is a natural coping mechanism for most women.
When a man needs space, it often has little, if anything, to do with you.
But lets get into it a little deeper and look at common reasons and scenarios where men need space, and what you can do about it.
Space Because of Stress
The number-one reason a man pulls away is that he is stressed. The source of his stress could be the result of some issue in the relationship, but it might not have anything to do with you at all.
Men dont typically like to talk about their problems and see it as a sign of weakness. A man prides himself on being able to solve issues and can feel extremely unsettled and off balance when problems emerge in his own life that hes not able to resolve.
Men will typically view themselves as weak and incapable if they voice their feelings or lean on other people for help or support. A guy might do it, but hell typically feel like a loser or weakling for asking for support or even talking about his feelings. The way women handle difficult emotions is probably much more psychologically healthy and healing, but it is what it is.
To cope with whatever stress he is facing, a man will typically withdraw and go deep into what has become known as a metaphorical man cave.
He will want to hide away until he has reached a solution. This doesnt necessarily mean hes sitting down and strategizing on ways to solve the problem. Sometimes hell just immerse himself completely in something else, like playing video games for hours on end or work or watching sports.
Men have a much harder time processing and handling emotions than women do. They dont have the same kinds of support systems, and sharing their innermost thoughts and feelings just doesnt come naturally to them. For him, escaping his feelings temporarily is sometimes more beneficial than trying to sort through them.
A University of Vienna neuroscience lab found that men become more self-centered and less empathetic when theyre stressed out.  Women, however, react in the opposite way, becoming prosocial and better able to distinguish their own emotions and intentions from those of other people. So it isnt personal, its just his process!
What to Do
The biggest mistake a woman can make when he is in this mode is to force him to talk about it. And even worse is when she tries to solve the problem for him.
Even though your intentions are pure, when you offer up solutions he feels emasculated. Men need to feel like they are in charge of their lives, like they are capable of solving whatever comes up. He prides himself on being able to solve things, and when you try to do it for him he gets the message that you dont trust that hell be able to figure it out on his own, and it makes him feel even worse.
When he is under stress, just give him space and try not to take it personally. If you get angry or frustrated with him, he will just see you as another source of stress in his life, and it will put more strain on the relationship.
Why is this so hard? Even though most women know about the man cave, they still have a hard time accepting it because women cope with stress very differently. When a woman is upset, she will typically want to talk about it with those she feels closest to. Talking about it is therapeutic, and a solution isnt necessary.
Because of this, if a man doesnt want to talk about his problems, the woman can take it to mean that he doesnt feel close to her, or doesnt fully trust her or care about her. She feels shut out and rejected and may come to resent him for it, thus exacerbating any problems that already exist. Its important to realize that when a man pulls back, he isnt shutting you out. It is just his process, and he will be back and better than ever once he has a handle on whatever it going on.
If he does come to you, dont try to solve the problem for him. Just listen. You can offer advice if he asks, but only if he asks.
Space in a Committed Relationship
Another main reason a guy can need to take space in a relationship is if his needs arent being met or he feels unappreciated. Guys arent always able to articulate their emotional needs. It could be because theyve been conditioned by society not to talk about such things or because they dont have the language to express what it is they want and need. Some men dont even realize their own emotional deficits, and that is an area where you can be a huge help to him!
A man wont always come right out and tell you what he needs from you, but he will know it when he gets it. So he might not tell you that he really needs your approval and appreciation. Maybe you do show him appreciation, but he needs more and he doesnt know how to tell you that. Instead, he backs away. He isnt as present or engaged, and you feel a palpable space forming and dont know how to break through.
What to Do
Try to pay attention to what lights him up and what shuts him down. If he is already deep in the man cave, engage in an open, empathetic dialogue and ask him what it is that you could do more of to make him feel good. You might be surprised by what he tells you. And no matter what it is, try not to get defensive. Your instinctive response might be, I do that all the time! but try to restrain yourself and hear him out.
You can also voice what it is you need from him. In any relationship, its important to check in with your partner to make sure both people are happy and getting what they need to feel loved. When you approach him from a place of genuinely wanting to make the relationship better and wanting to make him feel loved, he will be receptive to you.
Space in the Beginning of a Relationship
Many women, myself included, have been in situations where theyre dating a guy, things are going great, theyre spending more and more time together, getting closer and closer  and then he starts pulling away.
He might say he needs space, or he might just start taking it without warning. And the woman is baffled. What went wrong? She thought everything was going so well!
These situations usually happen for one of two reasons.
Reason One
The first is a very subtle, sneaky one. It comes from a mindset shift that happens within you. When a relationship starts to get a lot more serious, a lot of women reflexively freak out and become consumed with the fear that things wont work out. This fear causes them to cling tighter to the relationship, to associate their self-worth with how the guy feels. They think about the relationship constantly, obsess over what things mean, and analyze the signs looking for bad omens.
The guy can pick up on this energy. Maybe youre being subtle, but hell feel it on a visceral level.
All of a sudden he doesnt feel as relaxed around you and the vibe is no longer fun and carefree. Instead, he feels like hes being analyzed, like something is expected of him, like you dont fully trust him  and its a bad feeling. He might not be able to pinpoint it, but suddenly he doesnt feel as strong of a pull to be around you. I talk a lot more about this in my article on why guys suddenly lose interest.
What to Do
Dont stress, everything is fine! Your fears are real; Im not taking away from that. It could be because youve dated guys in the past who ended it out of the blue, and youre afraid of being in the same situation again. You might not have a solid sense of self-esteem and so you look to men to fill up your self-worth tank. Try to get to the root of this underlying fear so you can internalize that you are lovable and you do deserve lasting love with a great man.
Reason Two
Another likely reason is hes just freaking out a little bit because things are getting more serious. A lot of guys worry that a girl will become the gatekeeper of their social calendar as soon as a commitment is made, and they will have to say goodbye to watching football with the guys on Sunday, playing sports, and every other activity they enjoy. Maybe it sounds stupid and irrational, but its a real fear for most guys. A lot of guys have that one friend with a possessive, needy girlfriend who has to check in every five minutes and cant do anything fun, and that could be enough to scare him away, at least for a little bit.
What to Do
When you give him space and the opportunity to maintain his own life and do what he likes to do, this fear dissipates.
Dont stand in the way or make him feel guilty or tell him what he should be doing. Encourage him to be who he wants to be and do what he wants to do, and make sure you do the same. A guy may not always ask for space, but he will be grateful anytime it is granted to him. Giving space isnt an issue if your focus is on making your life an amazing place without needing him to make it that way for you.
When he has time to do his thing, either by himself or with his guy friends, he has the chance to recharge that part of himself.
And when hes fully charged, thats when youre going to find him the most attractive. Thats when hes going to be that ideal man that you want. And the same goes for women. Women need to recharge their woman batteries too by doing girly stuff with their friends. As a woman, you should never deny a man his time to recharge. This will also benefit you as well, so everyone wins!

89,Common Relationship Issues - Can You Fix Them?,2/19/2020,Sarah Adelie,https://relationshipsreality.com/?p=3652,"Common relationship issues, if they are not addressed, will make the relationship worse. They are not going to go away by themselves. Don't make the mistake many couples make when they accept these issues as ""just a part of their relationship"". When relationship issues are shoved under the rug, they become worse. They also create additional issues as well. Here are some common relationship issues many couples have and some ideas how to fix them before things get worse.

COMMON RELATIONSHIP ISSUES

1.) Family, and/or friends causing problems. Family and friends, no matter how well meaning, can cause major issues in a relationship. There are some family and friends that are purposely creating drama. Without drawing proper boundaries those friends and family members will never stop. You need to stop fighting with each other about it, and become a team. Both partners need to protect the relationship, and both need to stick up for one another. Draw a line in the sand. It is not asking too much for your friends and family to treat your partner and your relationship with respect. They need to give you space, and understand that if they can not behave appropriately you will have to keep them at arms length. It is not up to your partner to tolerate their bullshit for you. Your responsibility is to grow a set and put them in their place. If they really love you, it won't be hard to behave around the person that you have chosen as a partner. They had the right to chose theirs without your approval, so the same should go for you.
2. One partner doing too much, while the other does too little, is another common relationship issues. At a certain point the partner giving so much and getting so little in return is going to throw in the towel. Don't think you have forever to show them some appreciation and put them first for a change. If you are enjoying all that your partner is giving and have become selfish, your time may be up sooner than you know it. You are not considering your partners wants and needs. Start putting them first for a change. Let them pick what you do on the weekend, where you go to dinner, and what movie you see. Thank them for what they are doing for you and do something for them to show your appreciation. If you are the one giving too much, why not try taking it down a big notch so your partner is reminded of exactly how much you do for them?
3. Not spending enough time on each other and the relationship is another common relationship issue. This can be solved, but a concentrated effort really has to be made. Forget about the ""someday"" when you will be able to spend quality time together. That day may never come. When couples don't spend enough time together they grow apart, and one day they find themselves emotionally checked out of the relationship. At that point, it can be too late. It doesn't have to be grand gestures or 2 week long vacations. For a week write down everything you do for the entire week and the time each of these things takes. It can help you see where you can tweak your routine to create a little bit more time here and there. It can really add up. You don't need to be on social media playing games more than you need your partner, do you?
4. You argue about the same issues over and over again. This is one of the most common issues in relationships, and one of the most toxic. You are going to have to decide if these issues are really worth arguing over, first of all. Second of all, you have to both want to do what is necessary to solve these issues once and for all. You have to think long and hard and decide if you are going to let these constant arguments ruin your relationship entirely. Because they are doing just that, and eventually they will. Is this issue really worth losing your partner over? Can you find a compromise between the two of you? If you need a mediator, find a professional that you both feel comfortable to get help.

5. Spending too much time together, and having no time for yourself. Healthy relationships have individual ""me"" time. If your partner spend all their time with the kids, when you come home give them an hour alone to themselves here and there. Book them a message, facial, or anything to give them some time that is just about them. Healthy couples do not need to be around each other 24/7. They need time to grow as individuals or they won't really grow as a couple. This is often why people snap after a long time together because they want to ""find themselves"".",Percintaan
90,The Most Difficult People to Have Relationship With,9/5/2019,Sarah Adelie,https://relationshipsreality.com/?p=3562,"The most difficult people to have relationships with are those who behave in ways that make for unhealthy relationships. We should be able to spot these behaviors right away and recognize them for the red flags they are. In reality, most people choose to ignore these red flags altogether and make excuses for them. You don't want to get caught in a relationship with someone whose behavior is going to make it difficult, if not impossible to have a harmonious relationship.

So who are the most difficult people to have relationships with? We created a list of people with behaviors you should look out for:

THE MOST DIFFICULT PEOPLE TO HAVE

RELATIONSHIPS WITH

1. Controlling people are some of the most difficult people to have a relationship with. Their desire for power makes a true partnership impossible. They want to control everything, and everyone, at all times. No one really can be truly happy in a relationship with a control freak.

2. People who do not open up about what is going on in their minds, or express their feelings are extremely difficult to get close to. You have to guess their thoughts and desires, and how they feel about things (and you). You can't really get close to someone if they wont show you how they feel or what they are thinking. Without growing closer, the relationship stagnates and cannot grow moving forward.

3. Someone who never takes responsibility for their words and actions are frustrating to deal with. It is difficult to deal with someone who will not be held accountable for anything they do or say that is wrong. These same people will fully expect you to take responsibility for your words and actions. (And more than likely, theirs as well)

4. Liars and cheaters (we combined these two since they go hand in hand in many cases) are very difficult to have a happy, lasting relationship with. No one likes to be lied to, and without the truth, you have no trust. Once trust is broken, it is hard to fix and is never the same. The same goes for cheating.

The Most Difficult People to Have Relationships

With

5. Someone who will not apologize is another difficult person. Everyone has the capacity to apologize. These people choose not to. They like to cause problems, act out, and behave badly. They don't want to apologize because they don't want to admit they are wrong. They also do not want any consequences for their actions or words. How can you forgive someone when they are not sorry? Why would you forgive someone that isn't sorry for hurting you? You shouldn't.
23.37

58

6. Passive aggressive and/or manipulators are another group of problematic people when it comes to relationships. Being passive aggressive is a form of manipulation. There are many ways people can manipulate their partner. No one should be played for a fool, or have to deal with a puppet master that is trying to pull their strings for their own agenda. How can someone say they love you yet manipulate you at the same time? If your relationship involves passive aggression or manipulation, congratulations, you

are in a dysfunctional relationship.

7. Selfish people, who want the world, and your relationship to revolve solely around them are difficult people to be in a relationship with. You may go along for the ride at first, and think you don't mind, but that won't last. It is only going to get worse since you enabled them for so long. At some point, you will realize you lost a part of yourself and your partner didn't care that you were doing so. This imbalance will catch up with all couples at some point.

All relationships have conflict at some point, and are not always harmonious. That is reality. But do not delude yourself and excuse the red flags when they are waving in front of your face. Any other people come to mind that you feel are difficult people to be in relationships with, please comment below!",Percintaan
91,Cinta Mengalahkan Agama? My love story in a phase.,1/8/2023,Annisa Syifarani,https://medium.com/@annisasyifaranisa/cinta-mengalahkan-agama-my-love-story-in-a-phase-fdce94a35e47,"Disclaimer: dear a guy that I would date again, dont be offense. This story has brought me a lot and this is one of reason I could having a mature relationship as now.
Bener aja yang ditakutkan terjadi juga. Awalnya gak ada intensi apa-apa dari kenalan sama cowok di dating app kali ini, casual aja gitu. Makan juga di kaki lima daerah Patal Senayan, gak ada sesuatu yang wah deh dari nge-date pertama.
Seiring waktu berjalan beberapa jam, merasa ada sesuatu yang beda dari situasi date ini. Udah saling terbuka sama perasaan masing-masing. Bingung ya kok bisa langsung open? Sama.
Honesty
Kejujuran adalah hal yang utama buat gue dalam menjalankan hubungan dengan siapa pun. Lo jujur tapi gue dihadapi dengan kenyataan pahit, mungkin sulit gue terima pada awalnya. But we can handle every hurdle as long as were together, right? Seharusnya.
Dari kenyataan tentang latar belakang yang diceritain semua, jujur gue shock gak tertolong sampe ke-gep lagi nangis yang rasanya kayak diputusin deh ini, nyet.
Belum, ini belum tentang beda agama. Masih tentang latar belakang lain yang mana gak bisa (keluarga) gue terima.
Yes having a relationship at this age should be a serious one.
Cut Off (Rationality Over Feelings)
Dikejutkan sama banyak hal di date pertama ngebikin gue harus cut off ini sebelum jadi lebih jauh dan dalam. Betul, udah terbuka sama perasaan masing-masing, tapi please, udah cukup selesai di hari pertama ini aja, selama jalan pikir rasional gue ini masih jalan nih. Lagian kita beda agama juga kan, mau ngapain lagi?
Also, background kita 180 derajat berbeda. We cant take it no more.
How Dare You?
Say thanks after date is a manner, tapi gue udah bilang kan kita gak usah ketemu lagi, kenapa masih nanya plan gue besok ke mana? Apa urusannya?
Baru kenal  interest matched  surprised by your background udah cukup bikin hati gue yang kosong selama 6 tahun ini hancur lagi kok, mau bikin se-hancur apa lagi?
Just Caught In
Penolakan gue gak ngaruh ternyata, justru malah bikin makin tertantang ya. Kok ya effort lo tuh bisa sampe segininya, tapi kenapa kita harus beda agama sih? Dan kenapa background kita se-beda ini?
Oh No
Mungkin awalnya gue interested hanya as a human, semakin ke sini kenapa rasanya gue udah kenal lo dari lama ya? What kind of feeling is this?
Being Vulnerable (to each other)
Not for a being pity for you. But you showed me how vulnerable you are when Im with you. And I love that.
Gue jadi makin percaya, se-independen apa pun perempuan, being vulnerable jadi salah satu kuncian dalam how relationship works.
Relationship Built
Jauh sebelum mengalami hubungan ini sempet dikirimin Reels sama temen kalau hubungan itu dibangun, bukan dicari. Ternyata gini rasanya ya selama beberapa minggu gue mengalami proses dalam membangun hubungan dengan seseorang yang udah menginjak kepala 3.
Ini yang gue butuhkan untuk hubungan berdewasa, bukan karena sekadar penampilan dan pekerjaan yang bagus.
This Has Comes to an End
Mungkin selama 1 bulan lebih gue menjalani hubungan yang spesial tak berujung, sepertinya udah harus selesai di sini. Pun gue juga udah nyoba ngikutin alurnya tapi sejujurnya selama tidur, makan, kerja, bahkan bengong pun gue merasa gak tenang. Kalau gue melanjutkan ini lebih jauh pada akhirnya, gue gak bisa merelakan keluarga karena mereka lah prioritas tertinggi sampe kapan pun.
Good bye.
Terombang-ambing adalah situasi yang terjadi pada kedua pelaku dalam hubungan rumit ini. Kita berdua saling menginginkan satu sama lain, tapi ditolak oleh Tuhan kita masing-masing. Karena menginginkan bukan berarti yang dibutuhkan.
Pada ujungnya pun harus ada penentu dalam hubungan beda agama yang gak bisa disatukan, mau gak mau. Semua demi kebaikan masing-masing pelaku dalam berhubungan ini. Gapapa. Aftermath saking sakitnya tuh kayak kehidupan gue kenapa harus dibuat se-runtuh ini ya, Ya Allah?
Yang gue bisa bilang, thats all for own good.
Dear Readers
Im having empathy for you karena gue juga mengalami hal pahit ini. Pahit banget.
Meski berkali-kali dihadapi kebingungan, rasa bimbang, dan konflik batin, nangis aja sepuasnya sampe kuota air mata hari ini abis. Besok kalau mau nangis lagi se-lama kuota air masih ada, nangis lagi aja. Besoknya kalau marah sama keadaan, yuk nangis lagi :)
Gue baru sadar kalau love wins everything kok, tapi yang harus ditetapkan adalah di atas cinta masih ada logika.
Pelan-pelan ya, gak perlu cari jawaban dulu sekarang. Nikmati aja sedih dan pahitnya. Semua ini sulit untuk diterima tapi semua tentang waktu.

92,"Mengapa Saya Meninggalkan Go-Jek, Unicorn Start up Indonesia",1/13/2023,Anggit Yuniar Pradito,https://medium.com/@anggit_pradito/mengapa-saya-meninggalkan-go-jek-indonesia-unicorn-start-up-17cb1313aff1,"Bekerja di Go-jek. Mungkin merupakan impian bagi sebagian orang di Indonesia, khususnya programer ataupun desainer. Produknya merajai pasar, menjadi salah satu must have app bagi penduduk indonesia. Sebuah unicorn startup dengan kucuran dana yang melimpah dari investor, uang tentu bukan masalah. Start up yang sedang di atas, menjadi sorotan publik. Menjadi Big Four start up di Indonesia. Orang yang bekerja di dalamnya tentu memperoleh perhatian masyarakat. Lantas, kenapa saya meninggalkan GO-JEK?
Mengapa memilih tidak lagi menjadi designer untuk unicorn start up?
Sebelumnya saya akan sedikit bercerita tentang UX Design, divisi saya bekerja. Bagaimana cara dan proses kerjanya dan apa yang membuatnya istimewa. Kalo boleh saya menyebutnya sedang dalam golden era, sudah matang setelah melewati halang rintang di masa sulit sebelumnya. Apa alasannya?
1. Design is a thing in Go-jek
Di GO-JEK desain sangat penting, maka GO-JEK mempunyai Vice President khusus untuk mengurusi. Monika Halim, tentu menjadi jaminan kualitas hasilnya. Pengalaman dan kiprahnya membentuk kualitas yang mumpuni. Jika kamu bekerja sebagai desainer di GO-JEK kamu akan dimentori dia. Momo, panggilan Monika, akan menjadi coach-mu. Siap mengritisi desainmu, membentuk karaktermu, mengawalmu berproses dalam mendesain. Kamu bakalan ditempa habis-habisan menjadi desainer yang terus tumbuh ke arah ke arah yang lebih baik.
Apa penting design bagi GO-JEK? Sangat penting. Setiap fitur, flow, pixel yang kita lihat di aplikasi telah melewati diskusi panjang lebar, testing siang-malam agar aplikasi yang di tangan pengguna merupakan yang terbaik. Untuk mencapai flow yang ideal kita (Desainer) harus berdiskusi dengan semua element produk. Mulai dari Product Owner, Product Manager, bahkan teman-teman dari Engineering. Semuanya bersinergi agar produk yang dihasilkan mampu mencapai tujuan bisnis dengan berkendaraan desain dan berbahan bakar teknologi yang terbaik. Desain dan desainer menjadi katalisator tumbuhnya produk GO-JEK.
2. Team yang Solid
Berbicara sesoal team, GO-JEK penuh dengan desainer-desainer terbaik. Semuanya sangat asik di dalam atau pun di luar kantor. Jujur, bekerja dengan mereka menjadi salah satu pengalaman kerja yang paling berkesan bagi saya. Cair, sangat-sangat cair. Tak berasa sedang bekerja, meski dalam tekanan deadline. Unik, lucu, menarik dengan karakternya masing-masing. Teamnya terdiri dari UX Designer dan UX Researcher yang berada di 2 negara, Indonesia dan India. Semuanya berdedikasi untuk membangun produk terbaik untuk masyarakat Indonesia.
Sedikit serius, soal pekerjaan. Desainer di GO-JEK dituntut punya ownership yang tinggi pada produknya. Desainer sangat-sangat dilibatkan proses pembuatan produk. Dari awal diajak membangun pondasi, meninggikan tembok, memasang genteng untuk produknya. Laiknya ibu dengan anaknya, desainer harus mengasuh produknya dari bayi hingga besar. Sejak dari konsep, wireframe, hingga development dan bahkan analisis data, desainer harus selalu ada. Diskusi menjadi menu harian, membahas apa saja untuk meningkatkan mutu layanan.
3. Over Communicate
Diskusi. Chat. Diskusi.
Riset. Test. Chat.
Cari masalah, identifikasi masalah, chat, solusi, solusi. Hampir setiap waktu kita selalu berkomunikasi, baik itu diskusi, debat, ataupun rapat. Asyiknya, semuanya open minded. Semuanya siap menerima challenge untuk memperjuangkan kepentingan user. Satu tujuan, untuk user. PO, PM, Developer, tak hanya desainer, mempunyai hak bersuara yang sama untuk memikirkan user. Apa yang terjadi, apa sebabnya, apa solusinya, apa tujuannya menjadi landasan dalam bekerja.
Setiap produk mempunyai kanal sendiri, bahkan setiap masalah mempunyai kanal diskusi. Setiap waktu. Semakin cepat semakin baik. Tak hanya urusan pekerjaan, grup Whats App yang isinya random? Channel Slack yang jualan barang bekas? ADA.
Untuk menjaga kedekatan, kami sering bertukar kunjungan. Kadang team Jakarta melancong ke Yogyakarta untuk kerja bareng. Bulan berikutnya team Yogya yang bertandang ke Jakarta. Bahkan, tak jarang desainer merapat ke India untuk bertemu developer produknya. Keintiman terus dijaga untuk merawat produk bersama.
Tak jarang GO-JEK membuat outing bersama. Semua divisi semua posisi berekreasi, menjaga bounding merawat semangat. Berbaur satu sama lain, melepas penat dari rutinitas karena tenggat. Apalagi perusahaan multi nasional. Perbedaan waktu dan tempat bukan menjadi masalah. Ketika anggota team berada di beda negara, komunikasi menjadi jembatannya. Over communicates. Bagi siapa saja, dengan siapa saja dan kapan saja. Kepada Product Owner, Product Manager ataupun Developer. Desainer harus berbaur bercampur ke semua bagian. Dan mereka adalah partner diskusi yang menyenangkan. Over communicate untuk melibas perbedaan tempat dan waktu.
4. Data Driven Design
Asumsi membunuh dari dalam. Benar, begitulah adanya. Bakal tak ada ujungnya perdebatan yang tak memakai data. Kamu akan bertemu asyiknya data driven design . Semua keputusan, harus dengan data. Bukan hanya asumsi, semuanya harus tervalidasi. Kamu akan bertemu ux researcher yang sangat membantu kerjamu. Terbaik!
Perubahan harus berdasar data, hasilnya terukur. Tak hanya semena-mena, berdasar naluri atau logika, semuanya pasti, dapat dipertanggungjawabkan dan terbukti. Testing dengan pengguna asli, wawancara dengan pengemudi. Mengumpulkan data sebanyak-banyaknya untuk memaksimalkan desain yang sudah ada. Terus tumbuh, terus berkembang.
5. Social impact
Kami selalu ditanamkan, kita bekerja bukan untuk diri sendiri. Tapi untuk orang banyak. Bagi mereka, puluhan ribu driver se-Indonesia. Yang bisa makan di Mc.D karena ordernya ramai, yang dulu hanya sebatas mimpi. Untuk mereka yang sedang diburu-buru waktu melawan macet dan butuh solusi.
Jikalau desainmu dipakai banyak orang, mampu sedikit membantu mereka mencari rejeki adalah kebahagiaan tersendiri. Tak terbeli oleh uang, bukan sekedar pamer keindahan, ini lebih sesoal hati. Bekerja dengan hati, maka uang akan menghampiri.
Jika ditanya, bagaimana bekerja di GO-JEK? Dengan jujur saya menjawab, pengalaman yang sangat berharga. Sekarang saatnya. Golden time!
Pertanyaan selanjutnya, mengapa saya keluar dari team design GO-JEK saat golden time-nya?
Terlepas dari isu sentralisasi, saya merasa inilah waktunya. Waktu yang tepat untuk saya mewujudkan impian, merealisasikan cita-cita. Membangun studio design sendiri, Omnicreativora. ???? http://omnicreativora.com/
Meninggalkan zona nyaman, menantang diri sendiri. Dari menumpang tenar start up terkemuka menjadi waktunya berkarya mandiri, berkerja sendiri.
Sebuah studio desain sederhana, dengan karya yang semoga megah. Berawal dari nol, betul-betul nol besar. Meninggalkan zona nyaman untuk membangun cita-cita. Bermodal pengalaman dan tekad, membangun dengan hati dan cinta. Kami merancang User Experience dan User Interface untuk produk digital, siap bermitra dengan start up untuk membangun Indonesia.

93,Bagaimana Memulai Startup di Indonesia?,10/29/2017,Andrew Ryan Sinaga,https://medium.com/@andrewryann/bagaimana-memulai-startup-di-indonesia-df3e0256041c,"(sebuah cerita dari dunia nyata)
Hai! Saya Andrew Sinaga, coFounder dan Managing Partner Pedals.id, Startup Accelerator Platform dan Early Stage Investor yang berbasis di Kota Bandung.
Saat ini kami mengelola pendanaan sekitar $10juta dan telah berinvestasi pada beberapa Startup dengan total nilai investasi $1juta.
Kami telah mendengarkan ratusan pitch (presentasi) bisnis dari Startup yang sedang melakukan fundraising (pengumpulan modal) dan telah memberikan saran dan masukan untuk puluhan startup potensial di Indonesia, khususnya di Bandung.
Tujuan saya menulis essay ini adalah untuk mencoba membantu teman-teman semua yang memiliki keinginan untuk memulai Startup tetapi belum memiliki gambaran sama sekali tentang langkah demi langkah yang harus ditempuh untuk memulai nya.
Pedals.id sering melakukan sharing tentang dunia startup dengan teman-teman mahasiswa, dan setiap sesi tanya-jawab dimulai, pertanyaan paling umum yang mereka tanyakan adalah Bagaimana memulai startup?
Saya tadi melakukan google search dengan keyword Bagaimana memulai startup di Indonesia tetapi artikel yang keluar di 3 page pertama, menurut saya kurang memberikan gambaran secara lengkap untuk para calon startup founder.
Banyak yang lebih ke arah tips dan trik atau gambaran secara umum tentang dunia usaha.
Semoga dengan essay ini bisa membantu teman-teman semua, khususnya yang memiliki keinginan untuk terjun dalam dunia startup agar mendapat gambaran lebih jelas tentang apa yang disebut startup dan apa saja yang harus menjadi fokus di awal mendirikan startup.
Spoiler Alert :
Essay ini akan sangat oversimplified agar dapat mudah dipahami oleh orang yang benar-benar awam dalam dunia startup.
Untuk yang sudah ahli atau merasa ahli, silakan membaca dari source lain. Terimakasih.
First thing first.
1. Apa itu Startup?
Sebuah bisnis yang dirancang untuk bertumbuh dengan cepat.
Saya coba ulangi sekali lagi
Sebuah bisnis yang DIRANCANG untuk bertumbuh dengan CEPAT.
Coba kita langsung praktek untuk mendapat gambaran tentang definisi ini.
Kisi-kisi :
Semua yang startup disebutkan terakhir.
Ada dua kriteria sebuah bisnis untuk dikategorikan Startup :
1.	Banyak orang menginginkan produknya (Market Size)
2.	Kemampuan untuk menjangkau dan melayani mereka (Scalability)
Semua produk yang disebutkan pertama dan kedua memenuhi kriteria (1).
Siapa yang tidak mau makan Indomie? atau beli tiket pesawat untuk berlibur?
Tapi hanya produk yang disebutkan terakhir memenuhi kriteria (2)
Kita bahas ya.
Case 1 :
Dari sumber terpercaya dalam perusahaan, sejak pertama Warunk Upnormal didirikan memang sudah ditargetkan untuk menjadi jaringan cafe lokal terbesar di Indonesia.
Dimulai dari 2 outlet pertama yang digunakan sebagai prototype atau proyek percontohan, Upnormal saat ini telah berkembang hingga lebih dari 50 outlet di 28 kota di Indonesia kurang dari 3 tahun.
Ini bukan kebetulan atau keberuntungan. Ini adalah hasil riset para pendiri Upnormal dari pengalaman mereka mendirikan franchise kuliner sebelumnya.
Mereka memahami bahwa untuk menang dan besar di bisnis kuliner mereka harus memiliki S.O.P yang lengkap dan tepat, jaringan distribusi (supply dan market) yang luas, serta investor yang siap mendukung growth mereka ketika prototype nya terbukti berhasil.
Saat ini jika anda ingin menikmati Indomie yang enak dan terjamin kualitas nya, anda tinggal pergi ke Warunk Upnormal terdekat di kota anda, karena mereka telah berhasil menjawab tantangan Scalability dari produk mereka.
Case 2:
Sebelum Traveloka berdiri telah ada ratusan bahkan ribuan Travel Agent yang berhasil membangun bisnis yang menguntungkan. Comes along Traveloka, dan saat ini sangat sulit untuk kita mampu bersaing di segmen tersebut.
Kembali di kasus ini yang menyebabkan Traveloka mampu menyisihkan para Travel Agent konvensional adalah karena sejak awal didirikan, para Founder Traveloka telah memiliki visi untuk menjangkau seluruh penduduk Indonesia dan membuat pengalaman membeli tiket menjadi sangat mudah.
Apakah mereka online travel agent (OTA) pertama? Tidak.
Apakah mereka OTA pertama yang berhasil mendistribusikan produknya dan digunakan secara lancar oleh jutaan penduduk Indonesia di seluruh pelosok negeri? Ya.
Scalibility. Thats the key word.
2. So, bagaimana langkah kita untuk mulai?
Umumnya, anda harus menjawab 3 tantangan berikut ini :
1. Market Size Challenge
Karena Startup dirancang untuk bertumbuh dengan cepat. Maka ketika menentukan ide startup pastikan terlebih dahulu bahwa Pasar yang ingin dituju cukup besar untuk mengakomodir pertumbuhan produk kita.
Ambil contoh Gojek, ukuran pasar yang mereka sasar terus berkembang seiring waktu. Initial Product mereka saja (Go-Ride) sudah memiliki potensi pasar yang besar, yaitu jutaan kaum urban Indonesia yang sering terjebak kemacetan sehingga membutuhkan ojek online untuk sarana transportasi.
Ukuran pasar tidak melulu soal jumlah orang, jika anda membuat sebuah startup software untuk klien perusahaan, besaran pasar dapat diukur dari berapa uang yang beredar di segmen software yang anda tawarkan.
Di tahap awal membangun ide untuk sebuah startup, lakukan riset mendalam tentang ukuran pasar dari produk anda. Buat sebuah kalkulasi sederhana jumlah uang yang beredar di segmen pasar tersebut.
Contoh :
Jika saya ingin membuat sebuah startup Chatbot dengan target pasar para pemilik Online Shop, dan produk memiliki kemampuan untuk membalas pesan dari para pembeli (menggantikan peran seorang admin) maka Market Size saya adalah :
total Pemilik Online Shop di Indonesia x (dikali) gaji seorang Admin di Online Shop per tahun / (dibagi) 2
Maka saya akan mendapat Total Market Size Potensial per tahun dari produk ini.
kenapa dibagi 2? karena tidak mungkin mereka mau memakai jasa kita kalau harganya sama dengan Admin, secara harga harus signifikan lebih murah.
2. Great Product Challenge
Kata Great atau Bagus dapat didefinisikan sesimpel ini.
Orang mau pakai produk kita dan orang mau bayar untuk pakai produk kita.
Bagaimana cara nya untuk tes di tahap awal?
Gunakan cara yang paling simpel dan paling murah.
Banyak yang tidak tahu bahwa Gojek pertama kali didirikan dalam bentuk Call Centre. Berikut step by step layanan awal Gojek :
1.	Konsumen menelepon Call Centre Gojek, memberitahu dijemput dimana dan tujuan kemana.
2.	Dengan aplikasi maps / waze, Gojek akan mengetahui jarak tempuhnya, lalu dikalikan dengan tarif dasar Gojek untuk mendapatkan tarif yang harus dibayar oleh konsumen.
3.	Setelah konsumen menyetujui harga, Gojek akan mencari tukang ojek dalam jaringannya yang paling dekat lokasi nya dengan titik jemput konsumen.
4.	Konsumen dijemput, diantarkan ke lokasi. semua senang, semua tenang.
Pertanyaannya : apakah dari langkah-langkah tersebut ada biaya besar yang dikeluarkan oleh Gojek? Tidak sama sekali.
Pemasangan telepon gratis.
Pemakaian maps gratis.
Pencarian armada ojek? gratis. membutuhkan kemauan dan kemampuan negosiasi saja di awal untuk mengajak armada gojek bergabung.
Paling hanya keluar sedikit pulsa untuk menelepon tukang ojek yang mendapat order.
Apakah langkah-langkah ini mampu memvalidasi pertanyaan berikut?
1.	Apakah konsumen membutuhkan Gojek?
2.	Apakah Konsumen mau membayar untuk Gojek?
Jelas iya. Langkah simpel, efektif, dan murah ini berhasil memvalidasi kebutuhan masyarakat akan produk Gojek.
Ini yang disebut Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Lebih jelasnya tentang MVP akan coba saya jelaskan di essay berikutnya.
Kebanyakan startup founder pemula ketika berpikir membuat startup selalu langsung ingin membuat website yang keren, yang memakan puluhan juta rupiah, atau bahkan langsung aplikasi yang keren, yang memakan ratusan juta rupiah, tanpa sama sekali memvalidasi terlebih dahulu produknya kepada Pasar. Jangan terjebak.
3. Distribution / Market Channel Challenge
Bagaimana produk kita akan sampai ke tangan konsumen?
Pertanyaan ini harus bisa kita jawab.
Cara termudah adalah fokus di pasar yang kecil terlebih dahulu untuk selanjutnya memonopoli pasar tersebut.
Kita ambil contoh kembali Aplikasi Chatbot untuk Online Shop Owner.
Jika saya adalah founder startup tersebut, maka saya akan sangat agresif mendekati salah satu komunitas Online Shop Owner di Indonesia, memberikan free trial dan promo kepada mereka, melayani komunitas tersebut sebaik-baiknya, memastikan 50% lebih dari anggota nya memakai layanan saya dan mereferensikan layanan saya kepada teman-temannya yang lain.
Kenapa lebih baik fokus pada satu pasar yang kecil dulu? Karena sumber daya anda di awal pasti akan sangat terbatas, baik dari segi finansial maupun sumber daya manusia. Dengan berfokus pada pasar kecil anda akan memahami apa yang menjadi kebutuhan nyata dari para konsumen dan mendapat feedback tentang kelemahan produk anda.
Data tersebut dapat anda jadikan dasar untuk membangun nilai produk (value proposition) yang akan dijual kepada konsumen di pasar yang lebih besar.
Coba kuasai pasar kecil tersebut, lihat celah dan hambatannya. dan setelah anda berhasil, sebenarnya anda tinggal copy paste saja strategi tersebut ke target pasar selanjutnya, tentu dengan beberapa penyesuaian.
Kebanyakan startup founder Indonesia, setelah launching produk, akan bertumpu pada FB Ads, Google Ads, atau Instagram Ads untuk berjualan produknya. Jangan terjebak. Go out there and sell your product!
Sekian essay pertama ini.
Berikutnya kita akan coba membahas tentang Founder dari sebuah startup itu sendiri. Bagaimana karakter dan skill set ideal seorang founder startup? See you guys on the next essay.

94,Designer *katanya,2/26/2021,Roa Nuha Kalijaga,https://medium.com/@roanuh/designer-katanya-e3a533f4fdaf,"Disclaimer\: Tulisan berangkat dari pengalaman pribadi kerja di dunia design. Semoga meluruskan paradigma dan stigma designer entry level yang lumayan bikin gatel. Jadikan ini salah satu referensi pendapat, gausah baper.
Mikir jangan sempit
Ga semua masalah solusi-nya dibuat produk aplikasi mobile/desktop.
Designer = perancang, tugas-nya merancang banyak hal lalu disimplifikasikan sesuai dengan kebutuhan pengguna.
Its already 2021, think big. Banyak aspek yang jauh lebih pengaruh dibanding sekedar membuat aplikasi mobile/desktop. Memaksa mereka menggunakan produk aplikasimu dengan embel-embel semua mudah dengan hanya aplikasi untuk menyelesaikan persoalan masalah, yakin? Pesen galon apa perlu dibikin aplikasi mobile? kalo semisal mereka justru memilih memesan lewat pesan WhatsApp/SMS karena jauh lebih efektif.
Ingatkan diri sendiri untuk,
	Find the right problems
	Set the goals
	Try to find the best solution options
User ga peduli designmu
Mereka lebih peduli what makes it enable something for them. Fokus ke visual design yang interaktif, intuitif, dan imajinatif ga akan buat mereka pakai (kecuali terpaksa).
Design ga melulu soal ikutin trend visual design, design more than that. Design itu complex, user satu dengan yang lain punya pandangan berbeda, how might we enable them by something we make. Hal yang sering kejadian ketika designer masih pake topi designer sewaktu melihat dari sisi user.
Try to understand what problems user had, what they needs, why they need it, how they needs fulfilled. Observe more, prepare more, then execute it.
Besok user mu berubah
Jangan cepat puas produk mu rilis, user mu bisa jadi ga lagi tertarik produk mu. Manusia itu makhluk yang kompleks dan progresif, apa yang hari ini dilakukan belum tentu besok-nya mau mengulangi. Sama hal-nya produk yang kita rilis, mereka bisa pindah hati karena mereka terus berkembang mengikuti apa yang menurut mereka cocok. Sesuaikan lagi dengan mereka, iterasi penting untuk menjaga user tetap loyal atau bahkan acquire new user untuk jadi loyal user. Kuncinya harus tetap monitor perkembangan after-release, produkmu yang menyesuaikan mental model user tidak sebaliknya.
Product yang bagus adalah produk yang selalu bisa diandalkan bagi user bagaimanapun kondisi-nya.
Jangan salahkan user
Ga ada yang nama-nya bad user (kecuali fraudster), yang ada itu bad approach yang design. Sama dengan konteks sebelum-nya, kalau product yang bagus adalah yang bisa menyesuaikan kondisi user-nya, bagaimanapun kondisi user dengan segala keterbatasan-nya masih perlu designer pertimbangkan ketika sedang merancang approach solution-nya. Bukan designer yang memaksa user-nya untuk menyesuaikan.
User mu bukan cuma yang ada di pikiran mu.

95,Berapa Gaji Yoel?,9/17/2020,Yoel Sumitro,https://medium.com/@yoelsumitro/berapa-gaji-yoel-c2db18600189,"Beberapa hari ini gw lagi ngobrol sama seorang designer Uber. Gw lagi mau minta tolong dia buat share pengalaman and knowledgenya ke tim gw yang baru di tiket.com. Sambil ngobrol dia bilang kalau dia ada bikin video youtube dimana dia share history gaji dia sebagai designer. Menarik banget. Lol. Tujuannya apa? Dia bilang untuk bantu designer2 yang mau negotiate gaji mereka. I think tujuannya bagus banget karena gw merasa dua kali gw selalu di-low ball juga. Entah kenapa I am always bad at salary negotiation. So ini gw ceritain cerita gaji-gaji gw sebelumnya waktu gw jadi IC (Individual Contributor) di bidang UX.
Gw bakal pake a single person monthly living cost dari Numbeo sebagai anchor supaya ga terlalu arbitrary.
1.	Guru matematika SMA (20092011)
Average living cost di Bandung (Numbeo) = 6172950 (living) +2197507 (rent) = 9,852,116 IDR
2009 = Rp 2,5 jt /bulan ~168 USD (0.29x to average living cost in Bandung);
2010 = Rp 5 jt /bulan ~336 USD (0.59x to average living cost in Bandung).
Ini ga ada hubungannya sih sama bidang UX. Tapi ini gaji pertama gw setelah lulus kuliah. Dan gw membuat kesalahan terbesar pertama = ga do riset. Ditanyain sama kepseknya How much is your salary expectation?. Gw asal jawab 2.5 million rupiah?. Dan bener aja, gw langsung dikasih. Padahal harusnya gw do my own riset. Itu sekolah national plus, yang guru-guru lainnya guru expat with gaji gede. Plus uang sekolahnya lmyan tinggi juga. Gaji gw per bulan aja ga bisa bayarin satu bulan uang sekolah anak kelas 10 yang gw ajar. Lol. Di tahun keduanya gw negotiate buat kenaikan gaji sama board membernya. Gw bilang Biaya saya beli buku tiap bulan aja kayanya lebih dari 2.5 jt :p Jadinya abis itu dinaikin dua kali lipat jadi 5 juta.
Lesson learned-nya: do my homework. Cari tau kisaran gaji tempat itu. Cari tau business model tempat kerjanya. Sudah profitable belum? Seprofitable apa?
2. UX Design Intern di sebuah perusahaan di Seattle.
Average living cost di Seattle (Numbeo) = 1157 USD (living) + 1674 USD (rent) = 2831 USD
2012 = 3200 USD /bulan, (1.13x to average living cost in Seattle)
Yang ini ga ada terlalu banyak lesson learn sih karena rate buat intern emang sudah standard and biasanya ga ada room for negotiation.
3. Junior UX Designer di Singapore
Average living cost di Singapore (Numbeo) = 1278 SGD (living) + 1915(rent) = 3289 USD
2013 = 5000 SGD /bulan ~3679 USD, (1.56x to average living cost in Singapore)
Nah ini pengalaman gw di low ball untuk kedua kalinya. Gw kaget banget ketika dikasih tau kalau junior engineer di perusahaan gw kerja itu digaji di angka 8000an. Tapi ya gimana, gw again ga do my homework. Kalau dipikir bodoh banget sih. Satu, gw ga tau kalau gaji di luar Indo itu biasanya dikasih gross sebelum tax. Walaupun tax Singapore sangat kecil, tapi tetep aja gw bodoh dengan asal bikin asumsi kalau itu 5000 sgd adalah net. Dua, gw ga minta relocation benefit. Walaupun akhirnya dikasih 5000 sgd buat relocation dari Seattle ke Singapore, tapi tetep aja gw harusnya negotiate this more. Tiga, gw ga melihat gaji ini compared to average living cost di Singapore. Begitu dioffer 5000 SGD gw langsung berasa Wow 50 juta!. Dan langsung ambil aja, padahal kan di Singapore, sewa 2 bedroom apartement bisa sekitar 3200 SGD, itupun bukan di CBD area.
4. Mid-level Usability Engineer di Jerman
Average living cost di Nuremberg (Numbeo) = 792 Euro (living) + 557(rent) = 1349 Euro
2014 = 4500 Euro/bulan ~5314 USD, (3.35x to average living cost in Nuremberg)
2015 = 5416 Euro/bulan ~6396 USD, (3.86x to average living cost in Nuremberg)
Titlenya Usability Engineer, tapi sebenernya Interaction Designer aja. Doing research and design di mid level. Kali ini gw ga di low ball. Tapi gw tetep bodoh. Bodohnya cuman satu sih, tapi fatal. Gw ga pertimbangin pajak!!! Waktu dapet offer 4500 euro, gw langsung Wow asik naik 30% dari gaji di Singapore. Dan langsung capcus terbang ke Jerman. Setelah sampai di Jerman dan dapet gaji pertama? Walawe! Netnya setelah potong tax tinggal 2800 euroan ~ 3300 USD. Jadi gaji gw turun sebenernya dari gaji di Singapore! Malah lebih kecil dari waktu jadi anak intern di Seattle. Lol. Tahun kedua gw dipromosiin, jadi lumayan lah jadi naik dari Singapore.. dikit.
5. Mid level  Senior UX Researcher di Perusahaan US based di Singapore
Average living cost di Singapore (Numbeo) = 1278 SGD (living) + 1915(rent) = 3289 USD
2016 = 11000 SGD /bulan ~8095 USD, (3.34x to average living cost in Singapore)
2017 = 14400 SGD /bulan ~10597 USD, (4.25x to average living cost in Singapore)
Berbekal di low ball dan salah fatal ga liat pajak. Gw jadi lebih pinter kali ini. Gw juga nemuin website https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Nuremberg ini buat gw make more informed negotiation. Gw juga lebih jago kali ini: gw cari competing offer. Jadi akhirnya gw bisa aduin offering ke 2 perusahaan yang US based ini. Alhasil lumayan lah, offer yang dikasih ke gw ga terlalu jelek.
Tapi ada satu lesson besar yang gw pelajarin: negotiate for saham/ RSU buat pre-IPO company. Karena ini pertama kalinya gw dioffer pake saham, gw asal happy aja. Padahal buat sahamnya, again, gw di lowball. Lol.
Tahun 2017 gw di promosiin jadi senior UX Researcher dan itu jadi titik gaji IC tertinggi gw.
Ini summary-nya:
Semua salary nya gross kecuali yang di Indonesia aja net. Pajak bisa bervariasi dari 20% ish tax di Seattle, 15% di Singapore, to 45% ish di Jerman. Abis 2018 gw ga jadi IC lagi makanya ga dilanjutin.
2009 = Rp 2,5 jt /bulan ~168 USD (0.29x to average living cost in Bandung)
2010 = Rp 5 jt /bulan ~336 USD (0.59x to average monthly cost in Bandung).
2012 = 3200 USD /bulan, (1.13x to average living cost in Seattle). UX Design Intern
2013 = 5000 SGD /bulan ~3679 USD, (1.56x to average living cost in Singapore). Junior UX Designer
2014 = 4500 Euro/bulan ~5314 USD, (3.35x to average living cost in Nuremberg). Usability Engineer
2015 = 5416 Euro/bulan ~6396 USD, (3.86x to average living cost in Nuremberg). Senior Usability Engineer
2016 = 11000 SGD /bulan ~8095 USD, (3.34x to average living cost in Singapore). Researcher II
2017 = 14400 SGD /bulan ~10597 USD, (4.25x to average living cost in Singapore). Senior Researcher I
Semoga transparansi ini dan lesson learned gw lumayan berguna buat yang mau negotiate gaji IC atau yang mau pindah negara. Semoga gw ga keliatan show off gaji juga. Data kaya gini prone buat saling banding2in and mungkin bisa bikin keluar pikiran insecurity for some. Please dont. Everyone has their own pace and path.
Tiket or Bukalapak? Nanti yah kalau gw udah ada beberapa data point lagi as a track record buat negotiate di management track. Tapi bad news-nya, for dua kali pindah di Indonesia (ke Bukalapak and ke tiket.com), gw ambil benefit cuts sih semuanya. Jadi emang beneran bad at salary negotiation is my middle name.
Cheers,

96,How to Find Confidence in Your Career Path,5/15/2023,Naomi Lopez,https://www.collegemagazine.com/how-to-find-confidence-in-your-career-path/,"As college students, most of us experience the uncertainty that hangs around the word career like a dark, heavy cloud. Figuring out our careers is not an easy task. Its even harder to figure out how to approach and navigate our career paths once weve entered post-grad life. In a world of constant change, how can we ever know that were doing things right? Fortunately, we can look to experienced, knowledgeable experts for advice on this topic. 
Check out the following list of tips from professionals on how to find and maintain confidence throughout your career journey:
1. Be open-minded  explore new subjects
Some of us enter university knowing (or thinking we know) what it is we want to pursue. We worry only about the requirements for our major, our long-term schedules and our academic success in the particular field of study. Planning and focusing on our goals is always important, but being too wrapped up in our long-term objectives isnt a good thing. We risk becoming close-minded, averse to exploring other subjects and opportunities.
(My passion) was something that I became aware of in college by being sort of forced to explore other things, UCLA philosophy lecturer Steven R. Levy said. It was something that I went into kicking and screaming, and I was eternally grateful.
Levy started college as a biochemistry major on a pre-dental trajectory. After being forced to take a required classical wisdom course, he fell in love with the field. He switched his major to philosophy at USC his junior year and even transferred to UCLA his senior year because they offered a better program (take that, Trojans). Serving as the perfect example of why we should remain open to new subjects, Levy has been a philosophy lecturer at UCLA for the past 13 years.
Take a music class, or history, or philosophy just something to broaden your horizons. If you dont do it now when you have the opportunity to do it, this is your education wasted, Levy said. Even if you achieve your goal and become the best doctor ever or whatever, you need to expand your horizons and broaden them. 
So try to avoid automatically complaining as soon as you enroll in that random G.E. class or prerequisite course. In fact, sign up for that random course, or at least be open-minded towards it. For all you know, you may discover a passion for it and it may become the foundation of your new trajectory. At the very least, you will have learned something new, which is the most wonderful opportunity were offered at college.
2. Focus on developing transferable skills
Another quality us college students tend to have is hyper-fixating on the particular field of study weve chosen. If were a business major, for instance, we think about our roles in the business field and how we would play a part in that industry. However, there are numerous skills we may learn that dont apply exclusively to a business career. These transferable skills skills that can be transferred into a multitude of positions deserve more of our attention. 
The big thing (that led me to where I am now) is knowing what skills I had and understanding that they fit into a lot of different types of jobs, UCLA writing lecturer Darien Johnson said. The problem is that we get so rigid in what we think we want and what we think its going to be that we are essentially closed off to surprise. 
If we pursue one particular career during the entirety of our college years, that makes us pretty limited in terms of career searching. This inflexibility may lead to difficulty finding a position, or a position that becomes null as technology continues to progress. Unlike the job market, the skills we curate over time are reliable, and they may very well be the most important things we take with us from college. Focusing on our transferable skills makes us more competitive, and thus gives us confidence when navigating the career scene.
3. Look for and be open to opportunities
Whether youre looking to add to your resume or get your foot in the door at a certain workplace, opportunity is what you should prioritize. First, we have to figure out what we as individuals seek in a position, and then be proactive about finding places that match up. Oftentimes, though, we might not find exactly what it is were searching for. We must remain open-minded towards opportunities that seem scary or foreign.
Find things you like, and look for opportunities to use them in places you never would have expected them to so you continue to grow, Writer, Trainer/Facilitator and Consultant Paul Signorelli said. 
If youre an aspiring writer, this might mean researching publications whose writing style you might fit and sending them your work. It may also mean saying Yes to a position teaching English in Japan and moving two weeks later. Signorelli did just this, and he met with great success after his return. Living and working within another culture is a unique experience most people dont have, and as a result he became more marketable. Being open to sudden, unexpected opportunities like this can pay off tremendously and help us gain more faith in our career journeys. 
4. Adopt a positive mindset
Unfortunately, its very easy for negative thoughts to overwhelm us during our career journeys, whether were still searching for positions or working at one already. Maybe youre a biology major, and youre struggling to find an internship position or drowning in MCAT studying and now youre rethinking your entire life. Maybe youve landed a high-paying position in your field of study right out of graduation, but you find no pleasure in the work itself and feel slightly unfulfilled. There are plenty of things we can nitpick about in this way that perpetuates a pessimistic mindset. 
A lesson I learned from my father when I was very young if you just grumble about what you dont like, youre going to be a really unhappy person your whole life, Levy said. If you can find something in just about anything to amuse you or capture your fancy, life is going to be a lot more pleasant for you.

97,How to Become an Employee Benefits Professional,4/20/2023,Petula Workman,https://www.collegemagazine.com/how-to-become-an-employee-benefits-professional/,"Think about the advice youve been given when searching for a job: Make sure to check out the employee benefits. But what are those benefits? Employee benefits are the non-wage portion of compensation such as health insurance, retirement plans, life insurance, disability insurance, pet insurance and more. Those benefits dont work in a vacuum they need people to help make them effective. Ever heard of an employee benefits professional? No? Youre not alone. This not-too-well-known but highly rewarding profession consists of the people who make employee benefits effective.
If you like problem solving and helping others, read on to learn how to become an employee benefits professional.
What does an employee benefits professional do?
Generally, employee benefits professionals break into two categories. One category includes individuals who work at an employer in a department that may include human resources or may be a stand-alone department such as employee benefits or total rewards. The other category includes individuals who work at organizations that help employers with employee benefits in a consultative role. Among others, positions include the following:
	Actuary
	Benefits specialist
	Communications strategist
	Compliance attorney
	Consultant
	Data analytics specialist
	Director of Total Rewards
	Financial advisor
	Global benefits specialist or analyst
	Human Resources manager or specialist
Broadly, an employee benefits professional is someone who has core knowledge of the various types of employee benefits and how to administer them for the benefit of employees and their families. That means a whole lot of things. There are so many types of day-to-day jobs. Youre really helping people. Helping them get the benefits of healthcare insurance and later retirement benefits. But you have this knowledge and education to be a professional and do it the right way, Director at Educational Program Development, International Foundation of Employee Benefits Plans Carey Wooton said.
Typically, employee benefits professionals gain expertise in either health and welfare benefits, such as medical insurance, life insurance and similar benefits, or retirement benefits, such as 401k plans. However, some individuals, particularly at smaller organizations, become familiar with requirements and methods of operation for both. Because both categories of benefits are heavily regulated, outside expertise in the form of legal counsel or other consulting fields often becomes essential. Thus, it is possible to become an employee benefits professional through related fields, such as legal, actuarial and other technical fields, but those professionals typically require additional or specialized education or training
What does it take to become an employee benefits professional?
Generally, organizations require an employee benefits professional to have a bachelors degree. Because employee benefits professionals come from many different backgrounds, no specific degree requirement exists. General business degrees are a popular choice for aspiring employee benefits professionals. In addition, education related to human resources will help an individual understand how benefits fit into the broader structure of employment.
While degree requirements vary by organization, often you will find someone with a degree in business or an analytical field. Employee benefits are governed heavily by federal and state regulations so having a certification in employee benefits is helpful. One of the premier certifications is the Certified Employee Benefits Specialist (CEBS), which is offered by the International Foundation of Employee Benefits Plans, Director at Benefits at Memorial Hermann Health System John Eshleman said.
Training with the CEBS program really sets you apart, Wooton said. It teaches you about the history and the nuts and bolts of employee benefits administration.
Notably, students can start their CEBS study at any time during their college careers because students complete the CEBS program through self-study. Granted, you may not really want to add any additional studies to your already heavy load of classes, but certification through the program can really give you a leg up. It takes between one and three years to obtain. Once you become a student, you can join the International Society of Employee Benefit Specialists (ISCEBS), which is where the real advantages arise. ISCEBS has conferences and networking opportunities that allow you to meet and network with working employee benefits professionals. Also, employers may pay for their employees to obtain CEBS certification, so you may be able to start in the program as a college student and then obtain your full certification once you start your career. 
What should you know about becoming an employee benefits specialist?
1. How much will you make as an employee benefits specialist?
Entry level positions start around $50,000 to $60,000 and may be hourly or salaried, depending on the nature of the role. A benefits manager averages an annual compensation of $115,000 to $120,000.
2. How much will you be expected to work?
On average, employee benefits professionals work 40 hours per week. However, certain times of the year require additional hours. These times of year revolve around annual enrollment or open enrollment. Enrollment periods allow employees to change their benefit elections, and that triggers a heavier workload for a few months.
3. What will your work environment look like?
Most of the time is spent in an office environment (either at the office or a home office). Many roles require the occasional on-site work for events such as enrollment or benefit fairs, Eshleman said.
Theres a lot of hybrid and even remote work. Sometimes, the work will be fully onsite, but that depends on the industry. For example, if you are a benefits professional for a manufacturing company, the employees are mostly onsite; thus, youd be expected to be onsite too, Wooton said.
In contrast, consultants more often spend time in other organizations offices. Consultants are frequently on the go or working remotely, but they also have professionals working in an office environment to support them and their clients. Because of the nature of their work, consultants often travel and can spend 25% to 50% of their time traveling to other locations and even internationally. Consultants also become involved with enrollment periods and see their working hours increase during the months prior to enrollment.  
Remote working is where its at, and spending time with clients and prospect clients is the majority of the work, U.S. Division Vice President, Sales Enablement, Gallagher, Kristy Ventimiglia said. Now, that can include Zoom or Teams meetings, so not all meetings are in person, but consultants spend most of their time with clients and prospects.

98,The Secrets of a Successful Internship,3/23/2023,Petula Workman,https://www.collegemagazine.com/the-secrets-of-a-successful-internship/,"Youve landed an internship, and it starts next week. Now what? First, take a deep breath. You are not the first person to face a first day of work. Even the folks youre going to be working with have been there. Second, after youve gone over the route to the workplace 15 or so times, double checked the email to make sure you have the right start date and called your mom three times, consider the following advice from folks whove been there, done that and survived to work another day.
Looking for advice on how to be a successful intern? Read on.
1. Put the pajama bottoms back in the drawer
Workplaces typically have written dress code policies. These policies vary from organization to organization and often reflect an organizations culture and industry. Find out what is appropriate before setting foot in the workplace. Dress policies typically categorize overall attire as casual, smart casual, business casual or business. Despite these descriptive categories, the designations dont always explain much. How casual is casual? (Note that casual is not so casual that you can wear your pajama bottoms to work.) What the heck is business casual? Is there such a thing as stupid casual? Can employees wear jeans? Do employees have to wear suits if the policy requires business attire? What happens when we do something outside of the workplace?
Interns should ask not only about standard attire but also ask if there are scenarios or events that result in changes, such as casual days or client meetings, Leader of the Early Talent Program at Gallagher Julia Szukala said. Ask to connect with a more junior team member who is closer in age and who may provide information on where to shop and which pieces would be appropriate to wear.
Younger team members may also have practical tips on complying with any requirements to cover tattoos or remove body piercings during office hours. They can also explain in practical terms how to translate general categories such as smart casual and business casual as well as share tips. For example, having a pair of pumps available to dress up an outfit or a tie handy to put on for a meeting can be a lifesaver. Adding a jacket to an outfit can also take an outfit from business casual to business in the blink of an eye. Dont hesitate to ask. Even the general categories can mean something different from organization to organization.  
2. Perform recon on expectations
Where should you go on the first day? Who will your manager be? Is any advance reading or studying required? Did you oversell any particular skills during the interview process that you actually need to acquire? (Just kidding. We know you wouldnt do that.) Find out what you can before you start.
I felt prepared and unprepared at the same time for my internship, University of Denver graduate Jillian Dragon said. Before starting, I was told that I needed to know Excel and learn certain financial information, but I didnt know what Id be doing on a day-to-day basis.
Consider setting up an appointment with a future team member to discuss logistics prior to your first day particularly if its been a minute since your interview. During the call or meeting, obtain information about the expectations for your internship and cover questions about attire, scheduling and prerequisites. Expectations include skills to be learned, work hours, type of work to be completed, potential work product and opportunities for job shadowing. Be prepared with a list of questions, but dont make the team member feel as if theyre having their deposition taken for a trial.
3. Be normal, but not too normal
Everyone wants to make a good impression, but sometimes that can keep you from being yourself. Take a deep breath. You deserve to be there. You already are good enough. Dont try to make yourself sound or appear like something youre not particularly if you want a full-time position with the organization youre interning with. Leave that fake London accent at home. You could be stuck pretending to be British for the next decade of your life.
If you want to have a full-time job, be yourself, but keep it work appropriate. Talk about what you like to do in your free time. Talk about The Bachelor. Remember that the people youre talking to are still just normal people going to work every day, Dragon said.
However, the suggestion that you be yourself comes with a caution. You should not be so comfortable that your language or conversation is inappropriate for the workplace. There is definitely a line that should not be crossed. Avoid telling the story of how your significant others parents caught you naked while visiting over the winter break.
Be really mindful of language in conversations, particularly casual conversations even if speaking with younger members of the organization. They too have an opportunity to review your performance, Szukala said.
That brings up the reminder that internships are often very long job interviews. At Szukalas organization, internships last for nine weeks with a week at the global headquarters and two weeks at regional meetings. That means three out of the nine weeks can involve many casual events, such as lunches, team building exercises and receptions. Those events are part of the overall process, and your behavior during any of those out-of-office situations can impact your performance evaluation.
4. Ask questions
No one expects you to know everything. Remember that the organization expects you to be there as part of a learning experience. Roll up your sleeves, hide your tattoos, leave your industrial bar in your apartment and sling that jacket over the back of your office chair. Its time to work and to learn.
Ask questions  learn  understand  contribute, Benefits & Human Resources Leader for Getir Tiffany K. Duncan said.
Her advice emphasizes the educational nature of an internship whether paid or unpaid. The underlying intent of an internship is to teach. Some teach skills. Some teach industry-knowledge. Some teach you that youd rather do anything else in your life other than work for that organization. Its all good. So, ask questions. Work to understand, and dont hesitate to contribute.
5. Take notes
Unfortunately, the need to take notes extends beyond the classroom and rolls right into your internship. When someone gives you an assignment, take notes. When someone gives you feedback, take notes. When someone teaches you something, take notes. When you have something to contribute, take notes. When you accomplish something, take notes. Those notes will come in handy in the future.
Take notes during your internship so that you have material to discuss in future interviews. Everyone gets that question: Tell us about a time you showed leadership. If you take notes during your internship, you can then leverage those experiences, Dragon said.
Taking notes also reinforces what youre learning and helps you to evaluate the progress youve made during the internship. If you took notes during an initial meeting to set out expectations for your internship, then at the end of the internship, you have the notes at hand to evaluate whether you and the internship met expectations. Plus, taking notes helps you to step back from potential emotional responses when receiving feedback.
6. Open yourself to feedback
Expect that one or more persons from the organization will provide you with feedback. If youre not getting feedback, ask for it. Have an open mind when you receive feedback. You may not agree with the feedback, but it provides a valuable window into how the organization views you and what it could be like working at that organization. When faced with feedback, Gallaghers Szukala offers sound advice.
Take notes. Always have pen and paper. You may get one-off feedback when you are not be expecting feedback. Taking notes allows you to have a reference point, but also to have time to reflect, and taking notes shows that you are actively listening. Listen first. Really be mindful about vocalizing any immediate response or asking questions right away. You can write down your questions while taking notes. How did I demonstrate? Could you clarify ____? Szukala said.
Such tactics give you more time to avoid emotional responses and allow you to receive feedback in a meaningful and productive way. Again, deep breaths. These folks intend to help. The feedback they provide, and the way they provide the feedback, help shape your path in the future. Just remember that you are there to learn, and perhaps you will learn something about yourself.   
7. Control the one thing you can  your attitude!
Alright. You dutifully hid your tattoos, left your industrial bar at home and slung your jacket over the back of your office chair, but youve discovered that you dont like the organization, you dont like the people around you and the office dcor is some strange mix of soviet-era drab and Dora the Explorer. Back to the deep breaths. Remember that youre there to learn, even if the lesson is that you dont want to work there. Focus on what else you can learn and show up with the best version of yourself. If you do nothing but complain and bemoan how much you dislike the place, that can make the experience even worse. So, control the one thing that you can your attitude.
8. Dont ride up and down on the elevator hugging the plant you drug in from the lobby after consuming your body weight in alcohol
You may be tempted to indulge at the open bar during a business function but proceed with caution. Remember that every aspect of an internship constitutes part of a long job interview. Even in casual circumstances, the organization expects you to behave in a professional manner. Many business events involve standing around in small clumps of individuals chatting while consuming alcohol. You may feel awkward without something to do with your hands and thus wish to occupy at least one hand with a beverage. Bartenders provide non-alcoholic beverages too and will not bat an eye if you ask for a soft drink or a sparkling water. If you do opt for an alcoholic drink, consider getting one drink that you sip occasionally from during the length of the event. (Assuming that you are legally old enough to drink alcohol.)
But dont be that intern. Yup. That one. The one who indulges too heavily in the free alcohol and finds a nice Ficus plant named Fred who just wants to ride up and down on the elevator with you. Step away from the bar. Step away from Fred. And, by all means, do not drag Fred from the lobby into the elevator, even if you dont intend to ride up and down with him all night.  
9. Find a mentor
Youve probably heard the refrain: Find a mentor. Find a mentor. But what is a mentor? Generally, mentors include individuals with more experience who are willing to informally guide you. While you may not slide into the role of a mentee right away, a relationship you establish during your internship may lead to a later mentorship. To that end, look for individuals with an active role in the internship process at the organization.
Build relationships with the employees invested in the internship program. It is likely supported by some volunteers that really care and are invested in your success, Duncan said.

99,Menjadi Penulis Mobile,1/22/2016,Irwan Bajang,https://medium.com/@irwanbajang/menjadi-penulis-mobile-51ce86afbb4e,"Saya tipe orang yang susah beradaptasi. Termasuk dalam pekerjaan saya, menulis.

Dulu saya menulis di desktop, dan ketika berpindah ke laptop saya lama sekali beradaptasi. Saya jadi agak bingung dengan scroll pad, bingung dan nggak nyaman dengan keyboard yang baru, jarak mata yang terlalu dekat dengan monitor. Saya jarang meninggalkan sesuatu yang saya pakai lama dan berpindah ke yang baru. Salah satu tipe lelaki setia.

Saya hanya pakai laptop jika bepergian. Sisanya saya ketik di desktop saya yang lama. Sampai lama kelamaan saya terbiasa dan justru sekarang nggak nyaman lagi kerja tanpa laptop. Laptop milik pribadi.

101,Menjadi Programmer dalam 6 Bulan (Pengalaman Pribadi),6/16/2022,Edi Djunaidi,https://medium.com/@edijun.id/menjadi-programmer-dalam-6-bulan-pengalaman-pribadi-66f5c4f9da32,"Menjadi programmer buat sebagian orang merupakan impian atau cita  cita. Ada yang berpendapat kita harus menjalani pendidikan semacam sekolah atau pelatihan khusus seperti kuliah jurusan teknologi informasi atau kursus tertentu. Ada juga yang berpendapat menjadi programmer bisa dengan cara otodidak, dengan mengandalkan internet.
Buat saya pribadi menjadi programmer tidak harus dengan jalan formal seperti diatas. Dengan maju dan pesatnya teknologi internet saat ini, kamu bisa mempelajari apapun yang kamu mau. Namun tentu saja, kuliah dan pelatihan akan sangat membantu dalam prosesnya.
Ibaratnya kalau kita ikut kursus, pelatihan atau kuliah, jalan dan tahapan  tahapannya sudah disusun sedemikian rupa sehingga kita tinggal mengikutinya saja. Kalau otodidak kita harus pintar  pintar mencari sendiri jalan yang harus kita lalui.
Saya mengawali karir sebenarnya sebagai Graphic Designer. Karena pendidikan saya basic nya Multi Media. Saya menjalani profesi tersebut selama 2 tahun. Sampai pada akhirnya saya bertemu seseorang.
Dia adalah seorang web developer pertama yang ada di kantor saya. Saya banyak berdiskusi dengan dia dan mendapat banyak pencerahan tentang apa itu programmer, bagaimana, dan apa yang dikerjakan.
Saya sungguh tertarik dengan cara dia memecahkan masalah layaknya sebuah permainan teka  teki. Dengan itu saya memutuskan untuk memilih kuliah jurusan terknologi informasi.
Dimasa kuliah saya berfokus pada kelas  kelas yang mengajarkan pemrograman secara langsung. Beruntung sistem pengambilan SKS yang modular membuat saya bisa memilih mata kelas apa yang ingin saya pelajari duluan.
Hanya butuh waktu saya kuliah 2 semester untuk saya memutuskan berpindah karir menjadi programmer. Banyaknya kesempatan saya berdiskusi dengan rekan saya itu semakin membuat saya ingin jadi programmer.
Resign, nganggur 6 bulan
Saya beranikan diri untuk mundur dari pekerjaan sebagai graphic designer dan fokus untuk mempelajari pemrograman. Selama kurun waktu tersebut saya gunakan untuk mempelajari bahasa pemrograman java.
Beberapa referensi saya adalah :
Buku
Buku? Iya serius buku. Di era internet saat ini banyak sekali bentuk tutorial yang bertebaran di internet. Di youtube apalagi. Tapi kenapa buku?. Alasan saya karena saya membutuhkan suatu sumber belajar yang terstruktur dan menjelaskan secara detil tahap demi tahap. Membahas secara fundamental bahasa pemrograman yang dipelajari. Satu lagi, codingannya ga perlu saya ketik ulang, langsung copas dari e-book!
Salah satu buku yang menjadi acuan saya adalah Java: How to Program, 9th Edition (Deitel). Buku ini berisi hampir 1500 halaman, dengan chapter  chapter yang membahas secara detil dan aplikatif pemrograman java. Setiap 2 atau 3 hari saya berkomitment untuk menyelesakan satu chapter di buku ini.
Online course
Online course berbeda dengan video  video tutorial yang bertebaran di Youtube. Sama hal nya dengan buku, online course menawarkan system belajar yang terstruktur. Kamu tidak perlu mencari sendiri tahapan  tahapan yang harus kamu pelajari.
Blog dan e-book buatan lokal
Blog nya mas Eko, mas Endy, pak Romi menjadi teman saya di pagi hari sebelum saya memulai aktifitas. Tulisan  tulisan mereka menjadi acuan bagi saya seberapa jauh perkembangan bahasa Java khususnya di kalangan developer Indonesia.
Seminar dan Meet up
Saya cukup rajin menghadiri meet up  meet up developer khususnya Java, maklum pengangguran :D. Dari meet up tersebut pun saya mendapatkan ilmu, sertifikat, dan makanan gratis hehehe
Belajar saja tidak cukup, harus ada buktinya
Pada tahun 2013 saya sangat bersyukur karena pemerintah melalui Kementrian Komunikasi dan Informatika saat itu melalui lembaganya yaitu Badan Pelatihan dan Pengembangan Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi (BPPTIK) mengadakan pelatihan dan sertifikasi gratis. Kesempatan ini pun tidak saya sia  sia kan dan langsung saja saya mendaftar. Upload cv, menulis essay dan menjawab beberapa pertanyaan. Saya pun terpilih dari ribuan calon yang mendaftar. Waktu pelatihan berlansung 5 hari dan 2 hari untuk sertifikasi. Alhamdulillah saya berhasil lulus walaupun dengan nilai pas  pas an. Saya pun berhasil mendapat sertifikat profesi yang resmi dari pemerintah (yang ada lambang garuda nya itu lohh)
Cek Ombak
Setelah 6 bulan belajar dan sertifikat sudah ditangan, maka saatnya untuk cek ombak. Sebagai anak muda yang baru belajar Java selama 6 bulan dan tidak memiliki pengalaman sama sekali sebagai programmer saya tahu diri.
Maka dari itu price tag saya tidak berani yang muluk  muluk. Asal saya sudah bisa menginjakan kaki di dunia programming saya sudah merasa cukup. Kedepannya tinggal menunjukan diri saja kalau kita bisa lebih dari price tag kita.
Saya pun diterima di sebuah perusahaan di Jakarta sebagai seorang junior programmer, dan saat itu adalah awal mula dari karir saya sebagai developer.
Kesimpulan
Dari pengalaman pribadi saya ada beberapa point yang bisa saya rangkum untuk menjadi programmer otodidak ala saya:
Alasan yang kuat
Tentu tanpa alasan yang kuat kamu tidak akan bisa bertahan dan konsiten dalam perjuangan meraih yang kamu inginkan.
Belajar yang benar
Dalam belajar sesuatu saat ini memang sangat dimudahkan. Berlimpah nya sumber informasi di internet menjadi modal yang besar. Namun kita juga harus bijak dalam mencari ilmu di internet. Mengikuti kurikulum yang sudah baku akan sangat membantu kamu dalam belajar.
Buktikan dirimu
Pembuktian yang dapat meyakinkan perusahaan tempat kamu ingin bekerja. Pembuktian akan skill kamu dapat berupa contoh codingan kamu di repository, atau aplikasi yang pernah kamu buat. Dalam kasus saya karena saya 0 pengalaman maka saya mengambil jalan sertifikasi.
Berani
Terakhir kamu harus berani mendobrak segala skptisme yang ada. Saya masih ingat di hari saya mengajukan resign dan saya bilang mau jadi programmer, Bos saya bilang Emang kamu bisa apa kalau di programming? paling ujung  ujungnya jadi admin. Terima kasih pak, bapak justru telah menyiram bensin ke api semangat saya yang sudah berkobar  kobar.

102,Pentingnya Profesionalisme di Industri Start Up,11/25/2019,Fajrin Rasyid,https://medium.com/@fajrinrasyid/pentingnya-profesionalisme-di-industri-startup-676a2a09aa48,"Karyawan seperti apa sih yang dicari oleh Bukalapak?
Saya memperoleh pertanyaan ini beberapa waktu lalu. Saya mencoba menuangkan lebih detail di artikel ini sebab saya pikir hal ini tidak hanya berlaku bagi orang yang ingin berkontribusi di Bukalapak tetapi juga di kebanyakan startup berkualitas lainnya di Indonesia.
First thing first, quality matters
Bukalapak dan startup lainnya memerlukan talenta yang berkualitas tinggi. Sudah merupakan rahasia umum bahwa industri startup sangat memerlukan SDM dalam jumlah besar sehingga terjadi gap antara kebutuhan industri dan supply tenaga kerja yang ada khususnya di bidang TI. Hal ini pula yang menyebabkan Bukalapak beberapa kali bekerjasama dengan perguruan tinggi melalui berbagai program seperti riset, magang, beasiswa, dan sebagainya agar memperkecil kesenjangan tersebut.
Oleh karena itu, apabila kita ingin berkecimpung di dunia startup, maka merupakan hal mutlak untuk terus mengasah skill yang kita miliki. Mempelajari tren, teknologi, serta kakas terbaru, mengikuti online course, serta saling sharing pengetahuan dengan rekan kerja merupakan beberapa contoh hal yang harus dilakukan.
Update skill ini penting terutama disebabkan teknologi berkembang sangat cepat. Sebagai contoh, ketika Bukalapak berdiri tahun 2010, tidak ada mobile app developer karena memang Bukalapak berfokus di versi desktop. Berselang sembilan tahun kemudian, saat ini mayoritas pengunjung Bukalapak berasal dari mobile, sehingga posisi mobile app developer menjadi salah satu bagian penting dari perusahaan.
Menyesuaikan dengan budaya startup
Setelah memastikan hardskill kita terpenuhi, maka selanjutnya, sangat penting bagi kita untuk memahami budaya startup tempat kita bekerja dan apa yang diharapkan oleh startup dari karyawan mereka. Tentu saja, budaya startup beragam, namun sepemahaman saya  dan menurut saya merupakan best practices  beberapa di antaranya sebagai berikut:
1. Budaya eksperimen dan inovasi
Startup biasanya memberikan kelonggaran atau fleksibilitas kepada karyawan untuk melakukan eksperimen-eksperimen terkait dengan bidang yang menjadi tanggungjawabnya. Hal ini dilakukan dengan memberikan arahan yang cukup high level (misalnya KPI besar) saja, tidak sampai memberikan list A sampai Z yang harus dilakukan oleh karyawan.
Di satu sisi, hal ini menarik bagi kebanyakan orang karena biasanya tidak terjadi micromanage. Namun di sisi lain, hal ini berarti sebagai karyawan, kita dituntut untuk dewasa dalam bertindak. Terlebih, jika kita memperoleh atasan yang sibuk atau banyak mengurus berbagai bidang, sangat mungkin pekerjaan atau aktivitas kita tidak sering dipantau oleh atasan kita.
Dalam hal ini, penting bagi kita untuk tetap berpegang pada KPI atau tanggungjawab kita, dan bersikap profesional dalam memenuhi hal tersebut. Inisiatif untuk melakukan eksperimen atau inovasi menjadi hal yang harus kita pegang untuk mencapai hal tersebut.
Salah satu budaya di dalam Bukalapak yakni Try, Fail, and Try Again berlaku di sini, yakni Bukalapak berharap karyawan untuk berani bereksperimen dan apabila menemui kegagalan dari eksperimen tersebut, belajar dari kegagalan tersebut untuk melakukan eksperimen yang lebih baik lagi. Selain itu, Go the Extra Mile juga berlaku karena kita mengharapkan karyawan tidak hanya berhenti ketika KPI tercapai tetapi terus berusaha untuk memenuhi tanggungjawabnya dengan lebih baik lagi ke depannya.
2. Budaya kerja yang cepat
Secara umum startup memiliki budaya kerja yang cepat terutama jika dibandingkan dengan perusahaan tradisional. Budaya kerja ini tidak hanya terkait ritme kerja  kebanyakan startup menerapkan metode agile dan semacamnya untuk menghasilkan keluaran dengan cepat  tetapi juga terkait dengan bidang yang ditargetkan oleh startup tersebut.
Startup dapat melakukan pivot atau ekspansi bisnis dalam hitungan bulan. Sebagai akibatnya, apa yang harus kita kerjakan selaku karyawan di bulan ini mungkin saja sangat berbeda dengan di bulan lalu. Seorang karyawan Bukalapak pernah bercerita bahwa apa yang dia pelajari di Bukalapak (saat itu dia sudah bekerja di Bukalapak sekitar tiga tahun) jauh lebih banyak daripada apa yang dia pelajari di kantor dia sebelumnya  padahal di kantor dia sebelumnya, dia bekerja selama sekitar enam tahun lamanya.
Di sinilah mengapa lagi-lagi penting bagi kita selaku karyawan untuk terus mengasah diri. Mungkin saja tanggungjawab baru kita adalah bidang yang kita tidak kuasai atau familiar. Fleksibilitas untuk belajar dan mengerjakan hal yang berbeda-beda merupakan salah satu yang dibutuhkan.
Meskipun demikian, ada satu benang merah: startup bertujuan untuk memecahkan masalah yang dihadapi oleh pelanggan. Di sini, budaya Bukalapak Customer Obsessed berlaku. Apapun yang menjadi tanggungjawab kita, kita harus memiliki mindset bahwa apapun yang kita lakukan adalah untuk kebaikan pelanggan. Angka-angka KPI memang penting, namun memiliki empati dengan menempatkan diri kita sebagai pengguna startup juga tidak kalah penting.
3. Bekerja dalam tim
In the end, bekerja di dalam startup adalah tentang bekerja di dalam tim. Biasanya, karyawan startup berinteraksi di dalam tim yang terdiri dari berbagai keahlian dan latar belakang. Oleh karena itu, penting bagi kita untuk berempati satu sama lain dan menempatkan tujuan tim atau perusahaan di atas kepentingan pribadi.
Itulah juga mengapa Bukalapak memiliki budaya Gotong royong  budaya yang diambil dari tradisi yang sudah melekat ratusan tahun di masyarakat kita. Eksperimen dan inovasi akan berjalan lebih baik ketika pihak-pihak yang terlibat terdiri dari berbagai latar belakang namun tetap menghormati satu sama lain.
Bagaimana jika terdapat masalah ketika bekerja di dalam tim? Budaya Speak Up merupakan hal yang didorong di Bukalapak. Tentu saja, ketika kita menyampaikan pendapat, kita tidak ngomong asal-asalan. Jauh lebih baik jika kita berbicara dengan disertai bukti berupa data atau hal lainnya sehingga diskusi atau percakapan yang terjadi bersifat konstruktif atau menuju ke arah solusi dan bukan mencari atau menyudutkan pihak yang dirasa salah.

Hal-hal yang saya jelaskan di atas tentunya tetap berlaku ketika kita sudah bekerja di dalam startup  tidak hanya kita tunjukkan ketika kita ingin melamar pekerjaan di startup tersebut. Salah apabila kita sudah diterima bekerja di startup dan kemudian santai-santai atau tidak berusaha untuk meng-upgrade diri.
Selain itu, karena hal-hal di atas merupakan generalisasi saya terhadap budaya yang berlaku di startup, sangat mungkin ada perbedaan atau keunikan yang dimiliki oleh startup tertentu. Oleh karena itu, sekali lagi kita perlu mempelajari budaya startup tempat kita bekerja dengan seksama sehingga kita dapat menangkap dengan jelas apa yang diharapkan dari diri kita. Selamat menunjukkan profesionalisme di industri startup!

103,Menjalankan Bisnis Ala Introvert,8/28/2016,Mas Hartadi,https://medium.com/@mashartadi/menjalankan-bisnis-ala-introvert-e49f8b4cd538,"Ini opini lagi, berdasarkan pengalaman pribadi, hehehe.

14 Tahun lalu, seputaran 2002, saya ingat percakapan dengan seorang teman, intinya dia menyampaikan kalau mau bisnis, harus punya koneksi luas, harus kenal banyak orang, harus punya daftar nama orang penting, harus supel dan gaul, harus berani gambling, banyak deh syaratnya.

Dan itu sayangnya bukan spesifikasi kepribadian yang saya miliki pada waktu itu. Waktu itu saya : introvert, kutubuku, ketinggalan mode, sama sekali nggak gaul, lebih banyak berurusan dengan kode komputer dibanding manusia, dan terkadang menghalusinasi diri sendiri dengan ngobrol didepan cermin.

Untungnya apa yang disampaikan teman saya tadi nggak sepenuhnya benar, setidaknya nggak lagi relevan dengan zaman yang berjalan : Era Internet.

Internet memungkinkan pebisnis (pemula maupun senior) untuk berfokus pada core value, product dan service. Bukan lagi pada hiruk pikuk networking yang seringkali memakan waktu dan tenaga yang besar. Apalagi jika pebisnis (seperti saya) adalah tipe pribadi yang introvert, yang kurang cocok dengan hingar bingar kehidupan.

Jujur saja, saya lebih senang meditasi atau membaca di sarang saya, daripada menghadiri acara-acara komunitas/bisnis. Ya sesekali sih tetap hadir, tapi itu satu banding dua puluh lah, hehehe.

Ekonomi Web, sejak awal 2000-an, mampu menumbuhkan bisnis apapun, baik yang konvensional maupun berbasis teknologi IT, dan kabar baiknya, semua yang diperlukan untuk mempelajari Ekonomi Web tersedia gratis asal mau mencari di Google dan merangkai nya menjadi pengetahuan praktek.

Dulu saya mau bayar trainer atau mentor bisnis nggak kuat modalnya, karena harus menjamu, harus bikin janji yang seringkali molor, kadang harus mengekor kesana kemari, dan kalau trainer/mentor yang dibutuhkan ada di kota lain, tentunya harus punya akomodasi yang cukup untuk kesana.

Sekali lagi, internet memberikan kemudahan. 100% apa yang saya perlukan untuk memulai dan menumbuhkan bisnis, tersedia dengan cuma-cuma, tinggal merangkai dan menyesuaikan relevansi nya dengan bisnis aktual saya. Praktis hingga detik ini saya nggak punya mentor, kecuali satu orang yang luar biasa, paket komplit, makhluk langka.

Networking bisnis dalam kadar tertentu memang perlu, tapi tidak usah khawatir jika memang sulit membangun jaringan perkenalan. Orang introvert tetap bisa membangun bisnis dengan bagus bila fokus membangun sistem bisnis yang bisa mengakomodir ke-introvert-an-nya.

Contohnya, karena saya basic-nya programmer yang keahliannya membuat software, maka saya fokus pada membangun perusahaan dengan produk software utilitas yang dijual massal berbasis kebutuhan tertentu, daripada saya fokus mengerjakan proyek software e-Goverment yang mengharuskan saya kesana-kemari networking.

Jadi bisnis nya bisa apa saja, tapi cara menyasar dan menentukan segmen pasar nya yang disesuaikan dengan kepribadian kita.

Sambil bisnis berjalan, sambil upgrade pengembangan diri yang dibutuhkan, itu akan lebih nyaman, hemat energi dan pastinya hemat biaya.","Profesi, Pengalaman Pribadi"

Bahkan bootcampnya pun udah bisa puluhan sampe bingung kan mo pilih bootcamp yang mana. Bahkan salah satu bootcamp lokal yang menurut gw worth banget ga masuk di list dibawah wkwk (jangan tanya bootcamp yang mana, karna selain gw ga di endorse dan emang belum berminat juga, preferensi dan metode belajar orang beda-beda hehe)
Dari sini, setelah coba ngelakuin hal yang mirip gw lakuin di 2018. Gw cukup yakin kalo ini bakal kejadian juga di 35 tahun mendatang di Indonesia. Tulisan ini mungkin bisa referensi buat temen-temen yang mau masuk / sudah ada di bidang ini saat ini.
Tulisan ini cocok apabila kondisi teman-teman sedang:
	Ada rencana untuk shift ke bidang Data Analyst/ BI
	Sudah ada di role Data Analyst / BI tapi most-likely masih sangat bergantung ke tool tertentu.
	Secara sederhana gw akan bagi tulisan ini jadi 2 poin utama
	1. Alasan dibalik kenapa data analyst bakal overated/ over-supply/ dan semacamnya.
	2. Alternatif solusi buat tantangan diatas (dan mungkin buat kita-kita yang udah di DA supaya tetap relevan di masa yang akan datang)
Data Analyst Opportunities are declined
Berdasar dari riset beberapa sumber, data analyst role bakal overated dalam waktu 510 tahun kedepan. Kalo kita check dari source dibawah, walau data analyst berada di posisi teratas, dia mengalami penurunan yang cukup signifikan selama 5 bulan terakhir.
Dari gambar diatas sebenernya 3 role data pada turun semua, cumn yang ingin di highlight adalah si DA mengalami penurunan yang paling dalam. Ini juga terefleksikan dari Google Trend untuk keyword Data Analyst yang sudah mulai turun di US selama beberapa bulan terakhir.
While, di Indonesia sebenernya masih aman karna baru saja mencapa kondisi puncak.
nah kalo begini, bagus dong jik kalo masuk sekarang?
 hmm, I dont think so. menurut gw ketika kita udah berada di kondisi puncak dengan jumlah bootcamp yang sudah sangat-sangat banyak, soon or later ini role akan turun dan berevolusi
Self-Serviced Analytical Tools getting advanced
Kita bisa lihat dari contoh beberapa konteks bahwa aplikasi-aplikasi self-service analytics sudah semakin canggih.
	Mulai dari Tableau hingga Looker Studio, dimana business user saat ini bisa melakukan analisis-analisis sederhana buat ngejawab langsung hipotesa mereka. Urgensi untuk request ke Data Analyst akan semakin rendah dan ini bisa jadi reminder buat DA  DA yang hingga hari ini masih merasa nyaman dan aman berada di kondisi ini.
	Buat yang consider buat cobain ini role, saran gw adalah buang jauh-jauh ekspektasi kalau nanti kerjaan kalian hanya akan fokus di dashboarding , data-querying, dan data-cleansing saja.
	Bahkan ini lead gw pernah bilang yang kira-kira kurang lebihnya begini:
	jangan lupa fokus kasih business value, kasih business impact, ga peduli lu mau pake sheet kek, python kek, big query kek, intinya rekomendasi dijalankan, ada hasil yang bermanfaat buat bisnis
	Nah, buat kalian yang suka sama solve business problem atau identifikasi sebuah anomali, gw saranin lanjut aja. cuman kalo ekspektasinya sebatas dashboarding aja sih saran gw coba pertimbangin lagi yah.
Data Analyst getting fluent with basic DS
Terakhir, kehadiran ChatGPT akan sangat-sangat membantu role-role untuk kita yang berada di role ini buat expand ke basic Data Scientist.
Artinya apa, para DA kedepan menurut gw udah sangat kudu bisa basic DS. Kondisi ini juga udah kejadian di Facebook dan beberapa company gede di US.
Nah buat teman-teman yang:
	Udah ada di bidang DA, kondisi lu bisa basic DS soon or later bukan jadi sebuah skillset yang Nice-to-have tapi udah moderate to highly required
	Berencana masuk ke bidang ini, gw liat jarang banget bootcamp DA yang combina sama keahlian ini. Kalo ada bootcamp DS pun, gw liat jarang banget yang juga provide ngajarin seputar business mindset dan dashboarding. Jadi yah mau gamau kudu belajar sendiri lebih jauh.

105,Pengalaman Kerja: 3 Tahun Sebagai Programmer,11/23/2019,Ridoan Nasution,https://medium.com/@ridoannasution/pengalaman-kerja-3-tahun-sebagai-programmer-f8866c3bd21c,"Sebagian orang berkata bahwa programmer itu tidak ada kehidupan. Mungkin orang-orang yang berpendapat seperti itu ada benarnya juga.
Sebagian orang juga berpendapat bahwa programmer itu membosankan. Kenapa? karena kerjaan kita ya duduk2 doang sambil ngoding (menurut mereka). Kena diabetes dong kalo duduk terus?!.
Dan ada lagi yang berpendapat berbeda dari kedua di atas. Gw merasa perbedaan pendapat itu dalam kasus ini gak ada masalahnya. Karena setiap orang memiliki pengalaman dan pengetahuan yang berbeda dalam dunia pemrograman (coding) sehingga sudut pandang mereka tentu tidak sama.
Ngomong-ngomong, kalo menurut kamu, kesan mendengar kata programmer itu seperti apa ? (Boleh ditulis pada kolom komentar, teman2)
Tujuan gw dalam menulis artikel ini adalah untuk bercerita (sharing) pengalaman gw bekerja sebagai programmer selama 3 tahun. Jadi lu gak kerja sebagai programmer lagi ?. Masih lah. Cuma berhubung karena gw udah 3 tahun kerja sebagai programmer, gw pengen cerita ke teman2 gimana rasanya jadi programmer professional (eaaa 3x).
Ini cocok banget dibaca oleh adik2 yang lagi kuliah di Jurusan Sistem Informasi, Manajemen Informatika, Teknik Komputer dan siapapun yang ingin menjadi programmer. Jadi sebelum terjun ke dunia persilatan coding, ada baiknya adik2 tau lebih awal, bakal seperti apa sih kerjanya nanti.
Apakah ada deadline, tugas dikirim via e-mail, ada penilaian dan sebagainya. Atau jangan-jangan ada sistem DO (Drop Out) di dunia kerja ?
Ayo, mari kita simak pengalaman yang gw dapatkan selama 3 tahun bekerja sebagai programmer.
Tahun Pertama (2016  2017)
Setelah lulus kuliah dari Universitas Telkom pada bulan Agustus 2016, gw mulai sibuk cari pekerjaan sebagai programmer. Biasanya gw nyari kerja melalui internet seperti dari website JobStreet dan Grup Facebook PHP Indonesia. Pokoknya kerjaan gw dari pagi sampai malam cuma bangun, makan, buka laptop, cari lowongan kerja, kirim e-mail lamaran, dan tidur. Ehh, selain itu pastinya sholat dong (wajib bagi umat Islam).
Bulan agustus berlalu begitu cepat. Kerjaan belum juga dapat. Padahal gw udah lumayan aktif pergi ke Event EXPO lowongan kerja baik di kampus atau di luar. Dan pastinya ngelamar juga. Pada waktu itu target gw adalah menjadi programmer PHP atau JSP (Java). Soalnya gw paling demen sama kedua bahasa pemrograman tersebut. Sejujurnya, gw bisanya itu doang (hehee).
Hampir setiap hari, lamaran kerja via e-mail selalu ada aja yang gw kirim. Mungkin karena gw terlalu pengen mendapatkan pekerjaan secepatnya. Udah gak betah soalnya di kosan, diam dan gak ngapa-ngapain. Paling cuma nonton TV. Selain alasan itu, orang tua juga udah mulai nyuruh pulang kampung (Sumatera Utara) kalo pekerjaan belum dapat juga.
Akhirnya gw bilang sama ortu, kalo pekerjaan kayak gini (programmer) gak ada di kampung. Percuma juga gw pulang kan?. Mending gw bertahan di Bandung sambil berusaha cari pekerjaan.
Di bulan September 2016, mulai banyak lowongan kerja yang gw dapatin. Paling banyak tuh sebenarnya dari Facebook. Ternyata gak apa2 main FB selama kita gak nyia-nyiain waktu. Untuk hal-hal yg bener, oke lah. Kayak gw, cari kerja misalnya.
Gw dapat tawaran interview di salah satu Software Consultant di Kota Bandung saat itu. Gw gak bisa sebut nama perusahaannya. Privasi dikit lah (hehee..). Singkat ceritanya gw pergi ke kantor mereka di daerah Universitas Kristen Maranatha (sedikit bocoran). Rupanya bukan interview, test tertulis. Setelah test selesai, HR-nya nanyain gw Mau gak training selama 6 bulan dulu? Belajar tapi digaji loh.. Kalo gak salah gajinya Rp 500.000 / bulan. Kita memang beneran diajarin ngoding. Cuma karena gw menganggap gaji segitu terlalu sedikit dan gw juga merasa kalo gw udah bisa dasar-dasar dari PHP (ngapain lagi training?), gw tolak. Gw bilang, mending gw ikut test selanjutnya aja (interview) mas!.
Banyangin aja, di Bandung itu biaya kosan emang sekitar 500 ribuan (di kota-nya loh). Nah, dengan gaji segitu, gw bisa bayar sewa kosan doang. Terus gw makan apa? Batu? Semen? Ehh.. semen gak gratis loh.
Singkat ceritanya, gw pun interview di kantor klien mereka (daerah Leuwi Panjang). Ternyata perusahaan yang pengen merekrut gw adalah pihak ketiga alias Talents Hunter. Interview-nya gak selalu mulus. Ada beberapa soal yang gak bisa gw jawab dengan benar. Namun, pada akhirnya si Bos (Projek Manager) tetap meluluskan gw. Mungkin dia melihat ada potensi untuk berkembang dalam diri gw. Dia pun nanya, Kamu mau minta gaji berapa?. Gw pada saat itu minta 3 juta. Kalo gak salah UMR di Bandung 2,75 juta pada tahun 2016. Dia tolak permintaan gaji gw. Akhirnya dia sesuain gaji gw dengan UMR karena gw belum punya pengalaman. Katanya sih begitu. Akhirnya gw sepakat, tapi gw minta dikasih waktu untuk berfikir juga (sebelum tanda tangan). Setelah itu gw pulang ke kosan.
Selama perjalanan pulang ke kosan (naik angkot), gw mulai mikir2 apa keuntungan dan kerugiannya kalo gw menandatangi kontrak kerja tersebut. Si Boss juga bilang kalo gw gak bakalan dikasih gaji full (2,75) di hari penerimaan gaji. Maksudnya adalah gaji gw bakal dikasih 750 ribu dalam periode 4 minggu dan 2 juta di hari penerimaan gaji. Uang yang 750 ribu bakal dibagi empat (Rp 187.500 minggu) dan akan dikasih ke gw setiap awal pekan. Kemudian ada peraturan lain yang membuat gw makin gak berminat kerja di perusahaan tersebut, yaitu kita bakal dikontrak selama 2 tahun dan jika resign (bahasa arab-nya mengundurkan diri) dalam periode tersebut akan dikenakan denda sebesar 2 bulan gaji. Alamaaak .. udahlah gaji sedikit didenda lagi.
Setelah gw pikir2, ternyata lebih banyak ruginya bagi gw. Tapi gw gak mutusin begitu aja. Tetap, gw minta pendapat orang tua gw juga. Setelah mereka mendengar panjang kali lebar penjelasan dari gw. Mereka pun ternyata memiliki pendapat yang sama, yaitu jangan dulu alias tolak. Gilee ya?. Orang yang lagi butuh uang aja masih sombong. Hehee.. sebenarnya bukan sombong teman2. Ini supaya gak menyesal di kemudian hari aja.
Akhirnya gw pun memberi tahu kepada si Boss kalau gw gak jadi tanda tangan kontrak (via email). Dia pun heran dan langsung nelpon gw. Mas, beneran nih gak jadi tanda tangan kontrak?. Terus gw jawab Iya bener mas. Ini udah gw pertimbangkan dengan matang-matang. Kemudian dia nanya lagi Kalo boleh tau apa alasannya gak jadi ya ?. Hemm.. kepo juga nih si Boss. Gw bilang aja gini Gw udah dapat tawaran yang lebih baik mas. Padahal mah belum ada. Yaa.. dosa lagi deng. Niat gw sebenarnya supaya dia gak sakit hati aja. Mungkin juga teman2 di sini pernah berbohong dengan niat begitu.
Udah capek belum bacanya ?
Kalo udah, istirahat dulu teman2. Besok atau minggu depan disambung lagi. Gw janji gak bakal hapus kok tulisan ini. Hehee 
Kalo untuk teman2 yang belum capek, yuk kita lanjutkan cerita ini!
Hari-hari di bulan september tidak terasa berlalu begitu cepat. Lamaran udah dikirim kemana-mana. Tapi belum ada yang manggil interview lagi. Gw pun mulai ragu, jangan-jangan pekerjaan programmer ini gak terlalu dibutuhkan oleh dunia kerja. Gw banyak melamar ke Software House di Bandung. Salah satunya ada di Dago Atas. Kebetulan mereka sedang membutuhkan PHP programmer yang bisa pakai Framework CodeIgniter. Tau gak? Atau jangan2 teman-teman taunya cuma Laravel.
Di awal bulan Oktober mereka minta gw untuk datang Interview ke kantor mereka di Dago Atas. Kalo orang yang pertama kali ke Bandung, pasti terkejut mendengar ada Dago Atas. Gw awalnya tau kalo Dago itu ya Dago doang. Gak ada atas atau bawah atau selatan. Supaya gw gak kesasar, mereka (bos-nya kali ya atau recruiter) ngasih link alamat kantor mereka di Google Maps.
Singkat ceritanya gw pun pergi ke sana sekitar jam 8 pagi dan sampai di sana sekitar jam 10. Itu udah ada di dalam rumah (kantor) dari Software House tersebut. Setelah gw sampai ditanyai sama bos-nya, Udah makan belum?. Gw jawab aja Udah pak. Ya memang gw udah makan sih. Tapi si Bapak tetap aja gak peduli. Dia langsung minta anak buahnya (programmer lain) untuk beliin gw nasi padang. Selanjutnya dia nanya2 bentar dan langsung ngasih gw tugas. Tugasnya pada saat itu adalah membuat aplikasi sederhana PHP dengan fungsionalitas CRUD (Create Read Update Delete). Bebas topik dari aplikasinya, yang penting ada fungsionalitas tersebut.
Dan akhirnya gw buat aplikasi dengan topik Mahasiswa (miskin ide banget ya). Hehee.. yang penting ada. Ngerjain aplikasi ini harus pakai pure PHP gak boleh pakai Framework. Tapi boleh loh searching. Selama kurang lebih 3 jam (10.00  13.00 WIB), akhirnya tugas gw kelar juga. Horeee gw benar2 koding dari awal. Gak ada download source code dari blog orang loh. Cuma lihat-lihat tutorial aja. Abis itu gw terapin di kasus gw. Setelah gw kasih tau ke si Bapak bahwa tugas gw udah kelar. Kemudian dia suruh gw kirim projeknya pakai flash disk. Kebetulan gw gak bawa flash disk. Gw minta kirim ke email aja. Dia pun setuju. Dan.. gw kirim tuh aplikasi. Kemudian pulang ke Bojong Soang (Kecamatan di perbatasan antara Kota Bandung dengan Kabupaten Bandung). Orang biasanya sebut dengan istilah Bandung Coret.
Gw tunggu seminggu, 2 minggu dan sebulan. Gak ada berita dari Software House tersebut. Ya.. kalo gw lulus, bilang lulus kek. Atau sebaliknya, kalo memang gw belum pantas.. ya kasih tau juga dong. Biar gw gak kerasa digantung gitu. Padahal gw kan udah berharap supaya lulus di situ dan tinggal di Bandung lagi.
Life must go on .. gw pun tidak mau berdiam diri. Tetap gw pergi ke EXPO lowongan kerja seperti di Politeknik Negeri Bandung (Polban), Jalan Braga (ini sering banget, 2 atau 3x), daerah Gedebage dan lain-lain.
Gw pernah ketemu lowongan kerja IT Support sekaligus PHP Programmer di Bali (baca di Grup Facebook). Double job desk kayaknya ini. Gw tertarik juga tinggal di Bali. Kalo dilihat dari TV kan, Bali itu daerah yang sangat eksotis dan banyak tempat wisata. Jadi kalo gw kerja di sana bakalan asik nih, pikir gw. Bisa kerja sambil liburan setiap hari. Hehee Akhirnya mereka kasih soal untuk dikerjakan (via email). Tugasnya gak sulit sih. Dia cuma minta buat aplikasi PHP aja. Setelah selesai selama 2 hari, gw kirim. Kemudian ada cewek (recruiter kayaknya) yang nelpon gw. Dia nanya2 kenapa gw tertarik bekerja di perusahaan tersebut dan hal lainnya. Gw bilang tertarik pada saat itu karena gw bakal dapat pengalaman pertama sebagai programmer dan bekerja di kota berbeda. Namun gw belum tanda tangan karena gaji belum bisa ditentuin. Gw belum tau seberapa besar standar gaji di Bali. Jadi gw pada saat ditanya mau minta gaji berapa, gw gak bisa sebutin dong.
Sembari riset tentang gaji di Bali. Gw gak lupa untuk cari lowongan kerja yang lain. Saat itu gw lihat ada lowongan kerja di Jakarta untuk startup baru (perusahaan kecil, dengan 110 orang karyawan). Karena gw tertarik dengan perusahaannya dan lokasinya yang ada di Jakarta, langsung dah gw kirim lamaran lewat email. Gak lama kemudian, sekitar 12 hari setelah dilamar. Mereka pun bales. Pada saat itu yang menghubungi gw Mas Idur (Scrum Master). Dia pun nanya kapan gw bisa datang interview ke Jakarta. Gw bilang minggu depan aja karena gw gak punya uang yang cukup. Pada saat itu perkiraan gw minimal gw butuh duit 250 ribu untuk bisa ke Jakarta dari Bandung. Perhitungannya adalah 80 ribu ongkos sekali pergi (naik bus travel Baraya anti macet). Heheee Jadi kalo pulang pergi alias PP, gw butuh 160 ribu. Bener gak? Belum lagi makan minimal 2 kali (siang sama malam). Kalo makan pagi atau sarapan, ya di Bandung aja sebelum berangkat. Ya.. biar aman, gw harus megang duit lah sekitar 250 ribu.
Sebenarnya ini adalah yang ke-2 kali gw pergi ke Jakarta untuk interview kerja. Sebelumnya gagal. Gw gak mau ceritain itu di sini lebih jauh. Gw kan udah pernah ke Jakarta sebelumnya + the power of Google Maps, gw jadi udah tau di mana gw akan berhenti. Tanpa harus menunggu bus travelnya sampai terminal atau pangkalan dia (daerah Sarinah). Jadi gw gak perlu naik Ojek lagi ke kantor tersebut. Tinggal jalan kaki doang sekitar 500 meter.
Singkat ceritanya gw pun sampai di Kantor tersebut dan interview dengan beberapa orang (programmer di situ). Mereka nanya gw seperti: Lima tahun lagi kamu mau jadi seperti apa?. Batman kah? Superman kah? Heheee Yang jelas pertanyaan ini berhubungan dengan karir. Ya pada saat itu lowongan ini kan untuk Frontend Developer, jadi gw bilang aja Gw mau paham HTML dan CSS dengan benar. Intinya jagolah. Terus mas Idur bilang Kalo mau belajar CSS mah 3 bulan juga kelar. Yaa .. mungkin ada benarnya juga yang dia bilang. Atau mungkin dia melihat tujuan gw ini terlalu sempit. Tidak visioner. Mau gimana lagi?. Saat itu gw pengetahuannya cuma segitu. Gw jawab apa adanya aja.
Tidak lama setelah itu, mas Idur hubungi gw lewat telpon dan bilang kalau gw lulus. Gw kira berita kelulusannya lewat email. Makanya gw tunggu sekitar 1 minggu lebih walau gak ada balasan. Seperti biasa, beliau nanya berapa ekspektasi gaji gw. Sebelumnya kan gw udah pernah riset juga masalah gaji di Jakarta. Dan gw pun bilang gaji yang gw harapin. Syukurnya gaji yang gw ajuin disetuji perusahaan. Gajinya di atas UMR kota Jakarta sedikit. Lumayanlah untuk seorang pemula yang baru lulus.
Selanjutnya gw pun kerja sebagai Frontend Developer dengan bahasa pemrograman yang digunain adalah JavaScript (Framework AngularJs). Pekerjaan yang di Bali dan 1 lagi di Bandung gw tolak / batalkan. Maafkan ane pak.
Tahun Kedua (2017  2018)
Jujur ya, di 3 bulan pertama kerja (Nov 2016  Jan 2017), gw paling pusing dah. Kenapa coba?. Soalnya gw belum ngerti flow projeknya. Ditambah lagi saat itu kami pakai Pug (HTML Pre-Processor) dan CoffeeScript (JavaScript Pre-Processor). JavaScript aja masih belum ngerti banyak. Ditambah lagi dengan syntax CoffeScript yang asing banget bagi gw sebagai pemula. Belum lagi gw dikenalin dengan build tools seperti Gulp. Gulp itu bakal bantu kita merubah syntax CoffeeScript, pug, Scss untuk menjadi JavaScript, HTML dan CSS. Selain itu masih banyak lagi yang bisa dilakukan oleh Gulp. Wew .. untuk buat web aja sesusah itu pikir gw. Biasanya gw buat web pakai PHP, jadi konfigurasinya kan gak ribet. Cuma butuh file dengan ekstension .php, di mana di dalamnya terdapat syntax HTML dan script PHP itu sendiri untuk mengambil data dari server, menampilkan data dan sebagainya. Intinya gw pusing dah, banyak yang harus dipelajarin. Hehee.. sementara dunia kerja kan ada juga yang namanya deadline. Kita udah dikasih tugas (task), padahal kan kita belum mengerti semuanya. Malunya itu loh yang gak kuat kalo tugas kita gak kelar.
Sebenarnya gw dikasih belajar sebulan untuk memahami kodingan projek dari perusahaan gw yang pertama ini. Yaa.. gw cuma dikasih source code dan disuruh explore sendiri, kalo gak tau tanya. Kata mereka (senior gw) di kantor. Gw kan orangnya pasif, kalo gak diajak ngomong, gw susah ngomong duluan. Banyak malunya. Yaudah deh.. gw hajar aja baca sendiri source codenya dan coba jalanin di laptop. Jarang banget gw nanya. Akhirnya sebulan gak terasa, tugas gw pertama kali adalah unit testing (kalo gak salah) dan gak selesai. Kodingan dan flow-nya aja belum ngerti, gimana mau testing.
Akhirnya gw bilang sama senior gw (Frontend), gw gak bisa testing. Habis itu dia kasih gw link video tutorial AngularJs gratis di Coursera. Di situlah gw mulai belajar dengan benar dan senior gw pun mulai lah ngajarin gw lebih sering. Gw pun dikasih tugas yang lebih mudah. Kalau gak salah tugas pertama gw adalah menampilkan 5 gambar dari Instagram (akun perusahaan) di websitenya. Selanjutnya gw pun mulai pede (percaya diri) untuk mengerjakan tugas-tugas lainnya.
Saat itu gw di Jakarta udah mulai bosan kalo weekend gak ada kerjaan. Jalan-jalan pun udah lumayan sering, jadi ya gak seru lagi. Nah gw cari kesibukan seperti Nobar (Nonton Bareng) Liga Inggris. Selain itu gw juga ikut event Meetup JakartaJS. JakartaJS itu adalah sebuah komunitas programmer JavaScript bulanan di kota Jakarta. Event ini setiap bulan tempatnya beda-beda. Asyiknya dia sering ngadain Meetup di kantor-kantor gede seperti Microsoft Indonesia, Bli Bli, Bukalapak, Grab, Tokopedia, dan lain-lain. Jadi enak kan bisa jalan-jalan ke kantor keren seperti itu sambil cari ilmu juga. Dari event seperti ini juga kita bisa dapat cari kerja loh. Kadang-kadang di akhir acara ada iklan lowongan kerja. Hehee..
Gak terasa tahun 2017 pun mulai berakhir. Gw juga udah mulai pengen cari pengalaman baru (resign). Tapi pekerjaan baru belum ada yang cocok dan kadang belum lulus. Beruntung di awal tahun 2018, gw dapat tawaran kerja dari Tokopedia sebagai Frontend Developer. Gw terima lah. Kemudian gw ikut interview mereka dan disuruh ngerjain satu mini projek sebagai tambahan tugas. Alhamdulillah gw lulus. Gak nyangka gw. Karena dari 3 soal yang ditanyain saat interview, gw cuma bisa jawab benar 1. Tapi pas disuruh kerjain mini projek aplikasi React.Js selama 2 hari, gw bisa selesain dengan baik dan tepat waktu. Mungkin ini salah satu faktor kenapa gw diterima. Atau mungkin ada faktor lain? Siapa tau. Yang jelas HR dan orang yg interview lah yang paling tau alasannya.
Singkat ceritanya, gw pun resign dari perusahaan pertama gw. Dan mulai bekerja di perusahan baru pada akhir bulan Februari 2018.
Tahun Ketiga (2018  2019)
Waduhh.. ini adalah masa yang menegangkan bagi gw. Tau kenapa?. Ekpektasi gw bakalan mudah kerja di Tokopedia. Gw mikirnya karena gw udah punya pengalaman kerja sebelumnya. Dan di atas itu, gw ngebayangin kerja di Perusahaan Besar itu bakal indah dan selalu menyenangkan.
Ternyata 
Emang enak. Hahaa.. lu fikir gw bakal bilang apa?
Programmer alias Software Engineer (bahasa kerennya) di Tokopedia akan diberikan laptop (merk De*l), monitor (kalau kita minta), dan merchandise (topi Tokopedia, stiker, dan buku catatan). Gile ya, selama kerja di Tokopedia cuma sekali nyatat kerjaan di Buku itu. Kalo topi gak pernah pakai ke luar. Paling nyoba di kosan aja. Dan untuk stiker, lumayan lah. Gw tempel di laptop lah. Ingat! Kepemilikan laptop itu tidak permanen. Artinya lu bakal balikin lagi setelah lu resign dari perusahaan.
Balik lagi ke topik kita di atas. Gw sempat struggle (susah artinya dalam bahasa Arab) memahami boilerplate projek di Tokopedia. Boilerplate itu adalah template projek yang udah siap pakai lengkap dengan struktur folder, script development sampai production dengan mengikuti kaidah best practices. Btw gw kerja di Tokopedia di bagian Fintech. Sebagai catatan, tidak semua tim di Tokopedia memakai boilerplate yang sama pada saat itu. Gak tau kalo sekarang ya.
Gw kan udah ngerti dikit-dikit tentang React, tapi pas memahami flow projeknya gw kesulitan. Ditambah lagi dengan library-library pendukung React yang tidak sedikit. Kalo boleh jujur, gak ada onboarding untuk pengenalan projek atau tentang React pada saat gw masuk. Kalo gak salah, adanya cuma onboarding untuk Backend. Mungkin mereka belajar tentang bagaimana men-setup projek di Golang untuk dipakai di Tokopedia. Karena setau gw pada saat itu teknologi yang dipakai emang Golang untuk Backend Engineer.
Gw rasa setelah 3 bulan bekerja di Tokopedia, gw baru benar-benar nyaman menggunakan React. Lama banget ? Memang begitu adanya. Gw gak bisa bohong tentang ini. Mungkin dipengaruhi juga oleh gw sendiri yang pendiam (introvert) dan tidak adanya onboarding teknikal.
Susah senang gw lalui selama bekerja di Tokopedia. Mulai ngerjain projek berdua, sendiri, maintain projek lama (bug fixes dan tambah fitur baru), di-challenge / ditantang jadi backend dan sebagainya. Selama di sana gw juga udah pernah kerja di 3 lantai berbeda. Mulai awalnya di lantai 43, kemudian dipindahin ke lantai 45 hingga akhirnya turun ke lantai 29. Karyawan Tokopedia makin banyak soalnya jadi sering terjadi lift macet. Solusinya ya tambah pemakaian lantai baru. Fyi, Tokopedia kan pakai Tokopedia Tower sebagai kantor utama yang memiliki 52 lantai. Tidak semua lantai dipakai oleh Tokopedia, ada juga perusahaan-perusahaan lain. Tapi, mayoritas lantai adalah milik Tokopedia makanya nama gedungnya diberikan ke Tokopedia (kata teman gw sih begitu).
Enaknya kerja di Tokopedia saat itu adalah deket dengan Mall (Lotte Shopping Avenue). Jadi bisa sesekali makan di restoran Fast Food kayak Burger K*ng, Yosin*ya, KF* dll. Nonton Bioskop juga bisa loh. Jadi sepulang dari kantor bisa langsung jalan ke Mall untuk nonton. Apa lagi coba yang enak jadi karyawan Tokopedia ? Fasilitas Gym ada. Kalo lu gak malas olahraga bisa coba nge-Gym. Gw gak terlalu sering sih ke sini. Kita juga dikasih allowance (uang) setiap terima gaji yang dikirim ke akun OVO. Besarnya allowance itu menyesuaikan dengan posisi kita. Selain itu, di Tokopedia juga banyak programmer-programmer handal, lu bisa lah belajar ke mereka kalau mau. Atau untuk sekedar memotivasi diri lu menjadi programmer yang lebih baik.
Setelah bekerja selama 1 tahun 7 bulan, gw pun akhirnya memutuskan untuk resign dari Tokopedia. Gw berterima kasih banget sama perusahaan ini yang telah memberikan kesempatan untuk belajar dan membangun produk fintech untuk masyarakat Indonesia. Salah satu jargon Tokopedia yang menurut gw oke banget adalah Make it Happen, Make it Better. Gw setuju banget sama ini karena pada awal kita mengerjakan sesuatu ya kita mestinya bisa selesain dulu. Gak apa2 kualitasnya belum bagus. Namanya juga masih belajar. Nah setelah pekerjaan kita selesai, kita harus pastiin kita terus improve hasil kerjaan kita sebelumnya. Nah seiring waktu dan latihan yang konsisten, gw rasa kita akan bisa Make it Better and Happen pada percobaan pertama.
Sekarang gw udah pindah dari Jakarta ke Batam. Gw saat ini bekerja untuk salah satu klien Glints yaitu AIA Singapore. Baru sekitar 2 bulan gw bekerja di sini. Jadi gw belum bisa cerita banyak. Mungkin di lain waktu, gw bakal share ke teman2.
Pelajaran yang Bisa Diambil
Hidup ini penuh misteri. Gak semua yang kita mau terjadi begitu saja. Bahkan ketika kita udah merasa telah melakukan segalanya untuk mendapatkan itu. Yang jelas kita harus belajar bersyukur terhadap apa yang kita miliki sekarang ini. Dan tetap berusaha menjadi lebih baik di bidang yang kita tekuni. Ini lah beberapa poin yang gw pelajari selama menjadi programmer:
1.	Belajar Nego Gaji
Kita gak bisa pungkiri lah. Salah satu yang membuat kita semangat bekerja adalah gaji yang pantas. Dengan segala upaya kita dalam membangun software yang tentu tidak mudah dan terkadang membuat kita bekerja sampai lupa tidur, kita harus belajar melakukan negoisasi gaji. Mulai dari searching standar gaji programmer di Kota A, lebih spesifik lagi standar gaji di perusahaan B.
2.	Pikirkan sebelum menerima Pekerjaan baru
Jangan mudah tergoda dengan gaji yang gede. Tanya dulu apa Job Desk-nya secara detil. Bagaiman fleksibilitas jam kerjanya. Apa kah ada tunjangan lain selain gaji pokok. Adakah asuransi kesahatannya. Apakah programmer diperbolehkan cuti, kerja dari rumah. Dan hal-hal lainnya yang sesuai dengan kebutuhanmu.
3.	Belajar Berkomunikasi
Sebagai programmer kita bakal banyak ngomong sama Product Owner, Business Analyst, Engineers lain (Backend, Frontend, dll), Engineer Manager, Team Lead, dan sebagainya.
4.	Belajar Kontrol Emosi
Dalam tim yang penuh dengan orang-orang berpengalaman, akan banyak perbedaan pendapat. Jadi kita harus bisa mengesampingkan pendapat kita dan mendengarkan pendapat orang lain. Setelah itu diskusikan mana yang paling baik dan sesuai.
5.	Jangan Sombong
Meskipun kita misalkan programmer yang paling duluan ngerti tentang suatu hal. Kita harus tetap rendah hati. Jangan pernah merasa bahwa pendapat kitalah yang paling benar.
6.	Ikut Event Programmers
Kalo bisa sekali sebulan, ikut aja acara seperti Meetup di kota kamu. Contohnya kalo di Jakarta ada JakartaJS (group untuk JavaScript programmer).
7.	Jangan Malu Bertanya
Kalo misalnya udah mentok. Udah usaha nyelesain satu masalah kodingan, mulai dari cari di Google atau tanya di Stackoverflow gak dapat juga solusinya. Sudah saatnya tanya Senior atau teman lu.
8.	Atur waktu untuk Belajar
Sekalipun kita sibuk bekerja. Tetap saja kita harus sisain waktu untuk belajar memperdalam ilmu pengetahuan kita atau bahkan mempelajari bahasa / framework baru yang lagi sering diperbincangkan orang.
9.	Jangan Lupa Olahraga
Pekerjaan programmer ini emang penuh dengan deadline. Sampai-sampai gak ada waktu untuk hal yang lain. Sekalipun emang begitu, usahain aja olahraga minimal 1x seminggu. Hahaaa .. gw banget ini mah.
10.	Buat Target dan Strategi
Kita kan programmer, kerja di perusahaan swasta lagi. Waduuh, gak ada gaji pensiun loh. Paling ini doang BPJS Kesehehatan Dana Pensiun. Itu pun kalo perusahaan lu bekerja ngurus. Mungkin ditambah lagi gaji gak naik2. Padahal lu udah mau nikah atau mau beli motor buat transportasi ke kantor misalkan. Kita harus pikirkan lah apa target kita selanjutnya dan tentunya gimana kita mencapai target tersebut (strategi). Apakah kita akan selamanya jadi programmer ? Atau apakah kita mau gaji / title kita gitu-gitu aja ?
Penutup
Terimakasih teman2 udah mau membaca cerita pengalaman gw selama menjadi programmer. Tujuan dari artikel ini adalah untuk sharing aja sama belajar menulis juga. Hehee..
Jika teman-teman merasa ada kata2 gw yang berlebihan dan menyinggung perasaan teman2, gw terlebih dahulu minta maaf. Karena bukan tujuan gw untuk menyakiti siapapun dengan tulisan ini. Hanya sharing aja terutama buat adik-adik yang masih di bangku kuliah semester akhir. Persiapkan diri kalian dek untuk terjun di dunia persilatan ini !!
Gw sadar artikel ini tidak sempurna. Masih banyak pilihan atau penempatan kata yang mungkin salah sehingga sulit dimengerti oleh teman2.

106,"Pengalaman Jadi Content Writer, Seru Gak Sih?",7/31/2020,Melania L Anindya,https://medium.com/@melanindya/pengalaman-jadi-content-writer-seru-gak-sih-549217a7e87d,"Di era digital seperti sekarang, banyak posisi pekerjaan baru berkaitan dengan teknologi. Salah satunya adalah content writer.

Hmm, apa sih content writer? Kerjanya nulis gitu? Iya betul, kerjanya nulis konten untuk sebuah website. Tapi, bukan cuma nulis aja, lho!

Seorang content writer yang baik dituntut untuk bisa menulis konten yang berkualitas untuk pembaca sekaligus berada di urutan teratas dalam mesin pencarian seperti Google.

Meskipun dalam realitanya content writer gak cuma nulis konten untuk website aja, kali ini aku akan berbagi pengalaman tentang content writer dan penulisan konten di website.

Oh ya, perkenalkan namaku Melani! :)

Saat ini, aku bekerja sebagai content writer di sebuah corporate rasa startup di Jakarta dan sebelumnya aku sempat menjadi contributing writer di salah satu startup di bidang fashion.

Semoga pengalamanku ini bisa menjawab rasa ingin tahu kamu terkait content writing, ya!

Awal Karir Terjun Sebagai Content Writer
Jujur, pas kuliah aku gak ada bayangan sama sekali untuk jadi content writer. Aku ambil jurusan sastra prancis di salah satu universitas negeri dan tidak ada mata kuliah yang mengharuskan magang.

Pekerjaan pertamaku tidak berhubungan dengan tulis-menulis. Namun, aku mendapat kesempatan untuk jadi contributing writer dan hal ini yang mengantar aku ke dalam dunia content writing.

Singkat cerita, berbekal latar pendidikan sastra dan pengalaman sebagai contributing writer inilah aku sampai pada posisi content writer secara full time.

Tak Hanya Menulis Tapi Kenalan dengan SEO
Ketika awal bekerja sebagai full time content writer, aku berkenalan dengan search engine optimization atau SEO. Dengan SEO, tulisanmu akan lebih mudah ditemukan mesin pencarian.

Tapi tenang, kamu gak perlu jadi ahli SEO kok. Cukup tahu dasar-dasarnya saja seperti cara memilih keyword, menyelipkan keywords dalam artikel hingga penggunaan heading.

Ada banyak sumber untuk mempelajari SEO secara otodidak beserta tools yang bisa kamu gunakan di internet. Beberapa yang bisa jadi referensi adalah Ubersuggest, Whiteboard Moz, dan SEMRush.

Jika butuh bantuan lebih lanjut, kamu bisa ikuti SEO training seperti yang pernah diadakan Purwadhika Startup and Coding School atau Social Media Week Jakarta.

Menulis Konten yang Berkualitas untuk Pembaca
Hingga saat ini, aku masih terus belajar untuk menulis konten yang berkualitas. Aku percaya, tiap penulis punya standarnya masing-masing dan dalam hal ini penilaian cenderung bersifat subjektif.

Namun, ada beberapa hal yang sebaiknya diperhatikan ketika menulis konten.

Mulai dari pemilihan topik yang menarik, riset mendalam menggunakan sumber tepercaya, struktur yang baik dan penulisan sesuai KBBI, hingga gaya kepenulisan yang sesuai dengan brand yang dipasarkan di website.

Menulis konten dengan teknik storytelling juga akan membuat tulisanmu lebih hidup, menarik, dan mudah diingat pembaca.

Adapun tools yang sering kugunakan adalah Google Trends, PUEBI, dan KBBI online.

Selain itu, aku sempat mengikuti kelas online dan webinar dari Skill Academy by Ruang Guru dan Universitas Multimedia Nusantara terkait teknik storytelling.

Memantau media sosial, membaca buku dan artikel serta menonton film juga akan menambah ide-ide segar untuk penulisan khususnya yang berkaitan dengan brand.

Jadi, kalo ditanya content writing itu seru gak sih? Aku bakal jawab, seru! Alasannya, ada banyak hal baru yang bisa dipelajari selain menulis dalam content writing khususnya terkait teknologi.

107,Pengalaman Saya Selama Menjadi UX Designer Intern di Blibli.com,3/7/2018,Santi Lee,https://medium.com/blibli-product-group/internship-experience-as-ui-ux-designer-at-blibli-com-4c378e732779,"Kenalan dulu ya!
Halo semua! Perkenalkan, nama saya Santi, mahasiswa Computer Science yang paling ga suka coding, dan udah menjalani masa kuliah dengan jurusan yang salah selama 5 semester. Apakah itu hal yang gampang? Ga juga sih  iya lah, ga bisa ngoding :(
Selama menjalani kuliah, saya baru sadar ternyata saya lebih suka design dibandingkan coding. Jadi di semester 3 saya memilih peminatan ""Multimedia""  itu tuh, peminatan yang katanya tempat pelarian anak IT yang suka design, hehe.
Nah, saya sudah terjun ke dunia design selama hampir 6 tahun tanpa pengetahuan design yang baik dan hanya bisa menggunakan tools-nya saja. Ketika dosen saya memperkenalkan mata kuliah User Experience (selanjutnya kita sebut UX aja ya) di semester 4, saya merasa tertarik karena ini adalah hal baru bagi saya. Ternyata UX design itu tidak selalu subjektif, karena hal itu lah saya mulai tertarik untuk mengetahui dan mempelajari dunia UX.
Kabar baiknya, universitas di tempat saya belajar memberikan kesempatan secara langsung untuk mahasiswanya supaya bisa merasakan pengalaman dunia kerja, dan saya mendapatkan kesempatan untuk menjadi seorang UX Intern di Blibli.com! Yeaaaay!
Belajar & Kerja bareng UX team
Team UX di Blibli.com terdiri dari beberapa role. Ada UX Designer, Researcher, dan Copywriter. Selama internship saya juga diberi kesempatan untuk mencoba beberapa role ini, kecuali copywriter sih (bahasa Indonesia saya aja masih belepotan). Selain mempelajari cara menggunakan tools, proses sebelum mulai design (research dan mencari data), juga proses membuat wireframe hingga high fidelity, saya juga sempat belajar membuat animasi.
Pengetahuan baru yang saya dapat banyak banget! Tapi yang paling seru adalah pelajaran tentang UX process, Product Thinking, dan Problem Solving.
Saya mau share soal UX process yang sudah saya pelajari. UX process yang dimaksud di sini adalah tahap-tahap membuat suatu produk dari sisi UX. Begini kira-kira prosesnya:
1.	Product Definition: di tahap pertama ini kita mulai mendefinisikan apa GOAL suatu product/project, value-nya apa, dan seperti apa tolak ukur kesuksesan suatu product/project.
2.	Research: di tahap ini kita mencari tahu lebih dalam lagi apakah user benar-benar membutuhkan fitur ini, melakukan competitor analysis, dan masih banyak metode research lainnya
3.	Analysis: pada tahap ini kita mengumpulkan dan mengelompokan insight yang ditemukan pada saat melakukan research sebelumnya. Output dari analisis ini adalah report yang nantinya dapat membantu designer untuk membuat design yang benar-benar mudah digunakan sehingga dapat membantu user
4.	Design: Design ini adalah bagian yang paling saya sukai. Selain dapat explore styling designnya saya juga suka mencoba untuk design layout baru. Pada proses design juga ada beberapa tahap seperti membuat sketch terlebih dahulu, atau membuat wireframe dalam bentuk digital, hingga membuat high fidelity.
5.	Testing: Testing ini juga sangat menarik, karena saya belajar memahami user dan juga melihat pandangan user ketika menggunakan aplikasi itu seperti apa (Jadi kita ga berasumsi kalo user ini seperti A, B atau Z). Setelah semua design selesai dibuat, proses dilanjutkan dengan melakukan validasi dan juga mengumpulkan feedback dari user agar selanjutnya kita dapat melakukan improvement.
Sebenarnya masih banyak detail lain di proses ini, tapi kira-kira begitu singkatnya. Kalo mau belajar lebih banyak, yuk apply jadi UX intern seperti saya!
Di team ini banyak sekali orang-orang kreatif dengan pemikiran yang bagus, kadang-kadang out of the box juga. Cara kerjanya bisa dibilang cukup santai dan kami saling mendukung satu sama lain. Walau pun ini adalah pertama kalinya saya bekerja bareng dengan orang-orang yang professional dan sudah berpengalaman di dunia kerja, mereka membantu saya cepat bergaul dan belajar. Jadi saya nggak hanya belajar tentang softskill dan hardskil, tapi yang paling penting juga life skill :)
""Lingkungan kerja yang baik itu sangat penting karena banyaknya ilmu yang akan didapat tergantung seberapa banyak effort yang dikeluarkan.""
Jadi Intern itu ga cuma sekedar kerja kok!
Siapa bilang dunia kerja itu cuma ""kerja-kerja"" aja? (Kerja sih, tapi mesti ada refreshing-nya juga dong biar ga stress!) Selama magang di team UX bisa dibilang saya yang paling muda, dengan kata lain teman-teman di team ini usianya lebih tua (ups! Nggak maksud ngejek loh ya :p).
Kalau kata Kak Dio (UX Researcher) sih, ketika ada yang tanya tentang umur kamu jawabannya adalah: ""Umur mah ga ada yang tau!""
Walau pun jarak umur nan jauh di sana, mereka cukup kekinian kok (mungkin bisa dibilang SWAG gitu). Suka nge-jokes tapi bukan pelawak, suka kuliner tapi bukan chef, suka berusaha nge-jokes tapi gak lucu, dan masih banyak lagi.
Ini adalah beberapa tempat yang sering kita kunjungi di selang waktu istirahat sambil main game:
Entah kenapa, tapi mereka cuma mau main UNO ketika saya ada di kantor aja. Jika saya tidak masuk kantor game ini jarang banget dimainkan (nggak tau deh kenapa).
Sebenarnya masih banyak lagi sih yang bisa saya ceritain, tapi secara garis besarnya itu dulu deh.
Dan enggak terasa masa intern saya sudah berakhir, hikss. Thank you buat semua teman-teman UX-PM untuk pengalaman belajarnya, sharing ilmunya, curhatannya, dan jokes recehnya! Thanks for everything! Sarangheoooo~

108,Pengalaman Kerja Sebagai Programmer di Salah Satu Klien Glints Batam,5/3/2020,Ridoan Nasution,https://ridoannasution.medium.com/pengalaman-kerja-sebagai-programmer-di-salah-satu-klien-glints-batam-d9ccd79221d1,"Mungkin teman-teman sudah sering mendengar kata Glints.
Bagi yang belum pernah atau udah pernah tapi belum tau apa itu Glints. Ayo simak kutipan dari Wikipedia tentang Glints:
Glints adalah platform rekrutmen bakat online dan penemuan karir yang berkantor pusat di Singapura. Ini adalah platform untuk talenta muda untuk membangun kesiapan karir mereka melalui magang dan pekerjaan pascasarjana; mengembangkan keahlian yang dibutuhkan dalam berbagai karir.
Kembali ke Topik
Saya bukan mau mempromosikan Glints. Cuma mau ngasih sedikit gambaran saja kepada teman-teman. Intinya Glints adalah sebuah platform online untuk merekrut bakat-bakat terbaik untuk disalurkan ke perusahan-perusahaan mitra mereka.
Di sini, saya cuma ingin berbagi pengalaman saya selama bekerja di salah satu klien Glints. Saya berada di bawah Glints Singapore yang berkantor di Batam. Saya bekerja sebagai Fullstack JavaScript.
Saya sudah berada di Batam kurang lebih selama 7 bulan. Banyak pengalaman susah senang yang telah saya lalui di sini. Saat keadaan susah, saya mencoba untuk tetap tenang dan saat keadaan senang saya mencoba untuk tidak terlalu senang.
Untuk membuat artikel ini menjadi lebih ringkas, saya akan bagi menjadi 2 point utama:
1. SUSAH
Saat datang pertama kali ke Batam, saya merasa ini kota kok sepi banget. Ini di pinggir jalan kok masih banyak seperti hutan (pohon-pohon). Saat itu saya berangkat dari Bandara Hang Nadim ke daerah Kabil. Di mana saya akan mengontrak kamar di sebuah rusun.
	Sepi
Harus saya akui. Saat pertama kali ke sini, saya merasa ini kota sepi banget. Mungkin gak serame Jakarta di mana dulunya saya bekerja.
Tapi seiring berjalannya waktu dan saya juga sudah mulai sering jalan-jalan keliling Batam, pendapat saya mulai berubah. Batam memanglah sepi jika dibandingkan dengan Jakarta , tapi gak se-sepi yang dulu saya banyangkan.
Di Batam ini masih banyak mall, kurang lebih 610. Restoran cepat saji juga ada. Konsep lokasinya juga cukup unik karena ada di satu lokasi. Selain itu juga ada di dalam mall-mall.
	Angkutan Umum Jarang
Di beberapa kecamatan di Batam masih susah cari angkot. Adanya Trans Batam sama beberapa angkutan umum lain. Sayangnya di daerah aku (Kabil) gak ada yang lewat itu.
Ojek online juga lumayan lama nunggunya. Gak full 24 jam seperti di Jakarta dan kota-kota besar lainnya. Pernah dulu pas subuh (jam 5 pagi) pesan ojek online gak ada yang pick up. Akhirnya naik taksi online yang harganya lebih mahal.
	Kosan Jauh
Dari daerah rusun aku ke kantor Glints di Nongsa Digital Park berjarak sekitar 12 KM. Dua minggu pertama aku naik Ojek online + Bus Trans Batam. Setelah itu aku beli motor biar tidak terlalu boros pada ongkos.
	Dan lain-lain
Sebenarnya masih ada susah yang saya alami di sini, cuma ini ajalah dulu yang saya share. Yang penting-pentingnya saja.
2. SENANG
	Tempat Wisata Banyak
Batam ini kan pulau dan banyak juga pulau-pulau besar atau kecil di sekitarnya. Jadi gak bisa dipungkiri, banyak pantai cantik yang bisa dikunjungi di sini.
Sayangnya pantai-pantai di sini juga masih ada yg tidak terawat dengan maksimal. Sehingga pantainya terkesan kotor. Fyi, Pantai Viovio bersih loh karena ada yang jaga. Selain pantai ada juga tempat-tempat wisata lain seperti: Mesjid, Taman, Jembatan dan sebagainya.
	Tidak Macet
Ya di Batam ini memang gak macet. Bukan berarti gak ada macet. Setidaknya tidak semacet Jakarta lah. Aku gak nyalahin Jakarta loh. Ada banyak sisi positif Kota Jakarta yang mungkin belum dimiliki oleh Kota Batam.
	Jarang Banjir atau Kebakaran
Karena daerahnya masih banyak lahan kosong dan jarak rumah tidak terlalu rapat.
	Dekat dengan Singapura
Ya kalau mau jalan-jalan ke sana, tiket PP (Pulang Pergi) sekitar 280 ribu. Murah bukan ? Relatif sih. Bagi orang yang banyak duit tiket pesawat seharga 3 juta pun bisa dibilang murah. Kita bisa berangkat pagi dari Batam dan pulang malam dari Singapura. Bisa juga pesan hotel / pod dulu di sana untuk tinggal lebih lama. Bebas.
	Dan lain-lain
Pengalaman kerjanya mana, bang ?
Tenang! tenang!
Kalau kerjanya seperti biasa. Mungkin sama dengan kantor tempat kerja teman-teman. Secara tertulis, di sini masuk jam 8 pagi dan keluar jam 5 sore. Namun yang saya lihat rata-rata di sini orang masuk sekitar jam 10 an. Ada sih yang udah masuk jam 8, ya sekitar 48 orang. Dan biasanya ada juga yang pulang agak malam.
Di tempat saya bekerja, setiap hari ada daily standup. Semacam ngobrol satu tim mengenai apa yang kita kerjakan kemarin dan yang akan kita kerjakan hari ini. Dan jika ada kesulitan saat mengerjakan tugas, kita juga bisa sharing di sini. Siapa tau ada yang bisa membantu.
Mungkin teman-teman sudah familiar dengan Scrum. Itu adalah suatu kerangka kerja untuk mengelola pengembangan produk kompleks. Sayangnya di kantor kami masih belum 100% menerapkan metode ini. Terkadang hal itu yang membuat para programmer menjadi galau (Gelisah Lau). Kerjaan menumpuk dan dengan deadline yang mepet. Kurang baik untuk programmer. Walaupun kerjaan menumpuk tidak selalu terjadi di sini. Tapi cukup untuk menguras tenaga dan emosi. Lebay. Hahaa 
Sebelum terjadi wabah Corona (Covid 19), kita biasanya 23 kali dalam sebulan pergi ke kantor yang di Singapura untuk meeting dengan rekan kita. Misalnya dengan business people, UI/UX Designer atau Backend Engineer. Biasanya kita stay di sana itu selama 15 hari. Tergantung kebutuhan. Dulu pernah juga ikut meetup Azure di kantor Microsoft Singapura. Itu semua dibiayai oleh kantor. Mulai dari biaya transportasi, sewa hotel / pod dan uang makan.
Sekian cerita pengalaman dari saya. Jika ada salah-salah kata, saya mohon maaf. Tidak bermaksud untuk merendahkan siapapun atau tempat manapun. Ini murni pendapat pribadi yang bisa jadi salah menurut teman-teman, tapi benar menurut saya. Tergantung dari sudut mana kita melihatnya.
Dont judge too early
Kalau ada sumur di ladang
Boleh lah kita menumpang mandi
Kalau ada waktu yang panjang
Boleh lah saya menulis lagi
Cukup sekian dan terimakasih. Jika teman-teman punya pertanyaan tentang artikel ini, bisa kasih komentar di bawah ya. Kalau ada waktu luang, akan saya balas dengan cepat.

109,Pengalaman pindah haluan karir menjadi UX Designer atau Product Designer,5/12/2022,Borrys Hasian,https://medium.com/designchitchat/pengalaman-pindah-haluan-karir-menjadi-ux-designer-atau-product-designer-c40707436c8,"Di tulisan kali ini, saya ingin berbagi pengalaman dan hal penting yang saya pelajari, saat berpindah haluan karir menjadi seorang UX Designer atau Product Designer (selanjutnya untuk lebih simpel, saya gunakan sebutan Product Designer ya).
Lumayan banyak yang bertanya tentang hal ini, terutama setelah mengetahui bahwa sebelum menjadi seorang Product Designer, saya menjalani karir sebagai seorang Mobile Software Engineer.
Sekilas tentang saya
Saya Borrys Hasian, asal Bandung, Indonesia. Sekarang menetap di Singapura. Sekarang menjabat sebagai Senior Vice President, Head of Design & Research di ALAMI Group. Beberapa pencapaian profesional sebelumnya: Design Director di Gojek, Design Director di Singtel Group (Telkomsel salah satu dibawahnya), Head of Design di GrabFood, orang Indonesia pertama yang menjadi Google Expert di bidang Product Design, termasuk menjadi Google Global Mentor untuk Product Design di Silicon Valley, Amerika Serikat.
Silakan yang mau terhubung via LinkedIn. Saya juga aktif di Twitter dan memiliki channel Youtube Design Chit-Chat.
Menemukan aspek yang hilang dari pembuatan produk
Di tahun 2007, saya menjadi Lead Mobile Software Engineer di British Telecoms (BT), salah satu tugas besarnya: men-develop aplikasi untuk Transport for London. Tim inti ada tiga orang, dan semuanya Software Engineer. Selain sebagai Lead, saya juga satu-satunya yang memiliki software Adobe Fireworks untuk mendesain, sehingga saya yang ditunjuk untuk membuat desain  desain disini termasuk screen flow dan UI/Visual Design. Jangan tanya soal Design Thinking atau design process, saat itu pembuatan flow atau desain saya kerjakan sendiri, tanpa input dari pengguna, sedikit interaksi dengan tim bisnis dan tim proyektapi hampir semua desain (termasuk fitur-fitur) di-drive oleh engineer.
Kesadaran bahwa ada aspek pengguna yang kita abaikan, muncul saat aplikasi mobile berbasis Java 2 ME itu kita coba di situasi sebenarnya di London. Setelah menghabiskan waktu berbulan-bulan, ternyata beberapa fitur tidak berguna, termasuk kesulitan mengakses fitur di konteks sebenarnya (di stasiun kereta). Saat mencari referensi tentang aspek pengguna, saya menemukan beberapa buku yang membantu untuk sadar bahwa ada aspek pengguna dalam pembuatan suatu produk yang sukses:
1.	Designing Interactions dari Bill Moggridge  saya mulai kenal istilah human-centered di pembuatan produk.
2.	About Face dari Alan Cooper  saya mendapat pencerahan mengenai Goal-directed Design, membuat Persona (profile dari target users), dan membuat desain menggunakan narasi (Context Scenarios).
3.	The Humane Interface dari Jef Raskin (pembuat Apple Macintosh)  saya mulai belajar prinsip desain yang lebih mendasar, semacam filosofinya, termasuk landasan desain (yaitu user needs). Yang selalu saya ingat sampai sekarang: Building an interface is pretty much like building a house, if you dont get the foundation right, no amount of decoration can fix the resulting structure. Dan fondasinya adalah user needs.
Setelah mempelajari hal-hal diatas, saya tercerahkan. Masih sebagai Software Engineer, tapi pendekatan saya mulai membaik, ke arah human-centered. Diskusi tentang fitur dan produk, mulai mengikutsertakan pertanyaan seperti Apa yang menjadi masalah pengguna sekarang? Bagaimana mereka menggunakan layanan lainnya? Bagaimana kita membantu pengguna mencapai tujuan mereka dengan lebih baik? Hanya tetap prakteknya tidak optimal. Saya dan tim masih tidak berinteraksi dengan pengguna. Proses pembuatan produk pun jauh dari proses Design Thinking. Secara pribadi, saya menemukan excitement di bidang baru ini. Semakin tenggelam dalam bacaan mengenai desain, saya makin semangat.
Sebelum pindah haluan menjadi Product Designer
Ini yang mesti ditanyakan ke diri sendiri saat ingin berpindah haluan menjadi seorang Product Designer. Sebelum bicara Bagaimana?, tanyakan dulu Kenapa? Motivasi melakukan sesuatu bisa bermacam-macam  dari mulai potensi gaji/penghasilan yang lebih besar, jabatan yang lebih keren (mungkin), atau hal lainnya. Untuk saya sendiri, excitement dengan dunia desain itu sendiri yang jadi alasan untuk berpikir pindah haluan. Waktu kita di dunia ini hanya sekejap, jadi penting untuk kita melakukan hal yang membuat kita lebih excited, lebih bahagia, lebih meaningful. Apalagi dalam berkarir, dimana kita akan menghabiskan mungkin 7080% dari waktu hidup kita untuk bekerja. Hal ini juga akan berpengaruh pada ketahanan kita saat menjalani jalur karir tersebut. Selalunya di awal dari segala sesuatu, butuh usaha lebih untuk memulai. Melakukan hal yang kita sukai akan memberi suntikan energi yang besar saat muncul tantangan besar.
Jadi sebelum terlalu jauh bicara bagaimana cara menjadi seorang Product Designer, ambil waktu dulu untuk melakukan retrospective. Bisa coba menggunakan metode VITAMIN yang pernah saya share.
Luck adalah saat kesempatan bertemu kesiapan
Niat saya untuk berpindah karir menjadi Product Designer, bersambut dengan adanya kesempatan menjadi UX Designer di salah satu operator selular Norwegia yang ada di Kuala Lumpur. Dengan percaya diri setelah mendalami buku-buku tentang human-centered design, saya masuk ke ruang interview dengan Director of UX-nya. Tell me about your Design Process in building a product, kata interviewernya. Saya menjelaskan dengan percaya diri, panjang lebardan sadar bahwa saya melakukan kesalahan setelah raut muka direktur tersebut berubah. Saya mengatakan bahwa setelah saya membuat produk (di develop), baru saya tes dengan pengguna ???????. Ini a BIG NO untuk proses desain yang human-centered. Saat saya berjalan meninggalkan gedung operator selular tersebut, saya lihat formulir lamaran saya dibuang ke tempat sampah.
Sempat terlintas, bahwa takdir saya mungkin tetap di Mobile Software Engineer, tapi masih ada dorongan dan semangat yang kuat untuk mendalami bidang desain. Saya mengirim email ke direktur tersebut, dan minta direkomendasikan untuk posisi lain yang menurut dia cocok. Akhirnya saya direkomendasikan untuk menjadi Product Development (mirip Product Manager), dan Alhamdulillah berhasil mendapat posisi tersebut.
Setelah masuk dengan posisi Product Development, saya tetap kepikiran untuk mendalami dunia desain. Sambil menjalani posisi yang ada, saya mendekati tim desain, bertanya yang banyak, meminta referensi buku-buku terkait UX Design. Ini buku-buku yang membantu saya lebih memahami desain saat itu:
1.	Elements of User Experience dari J. J Garrett  dari sini saya mengerti hal penting tentang bagaimana UX itu dibangun, dari mulai Strategy (User needs and Business Goals), Scope (content and functional requirements), Structure (Information Architecture dan Interaction Design), Skeleton (Information Design, Layout, Hierarcy), dan Surface (Visual Design). Mulai terbuka bahwa desain itu bukan hanya tentang membuat flow dan screen, termasuk UI, tapi juga ada tahapannya dan dimulai dengan user needs dan business goals.
2.	Dont make me think dari Steve Krug  dari Steve Krug saya belajar hal praktis, termasuk konsep penting jangan membuat pengguna berpikir (atau sesedikit mungkin berpikir), dan jumlah klik itu bukan patokan good UX  fokusnya mesti di gampangnya setiap klik, bukan jumlah klik.
3.	Designing Interfaces dari Jenifer Tidwell  saya mulai mengenal UI (User Interface), termasuk best practices penggunaan berbagai komponen UI.
4.	Information Architecture dari Peter Morville  ini lebih ke overview membuat struktur informasi, hanya lumayan berat untuk saya yang baru mulai di desain.
Setelah mendalami buku-buku diatas, dan semakin sering berinteraksi dengan tim desain, saya jadi makin bersemangat. Dengan kondisi latar belakang sebagai Software Engineer dan gagal di interview sebagai UX Designer, saya menawarkan diri untuk menjadi intern di tim desain dan aktif menawarkan bantuan. Saat itu perusahaan sedang bertransformasi menjadi user-centric, dan tim desain sedang aktif membuat kampanye internal. Saya mulai dengan mengerjakan poster, kemudian membuat screen saver. Kelihatannya tidak penting, tapi hal-hal tersebut membantu saya untuk berinteraksi lebih banyak dengan tim desain dan belajar dari mereka.
Berikan lebih dan hal baik akan datang
Tidak terlihat tanda-tanda saya bisa mendapat posisi fulltime di tim desain. Muncul satu titik terang: ada proyek untuk meredesain website utama. Tanpa diminta (karena memang bukan job scope saya), saya membuat Heuristic Evaluation. Menggunakan Elements of Experience sebagai outline, saya buat detail evaluasi desain dari website yang ada. Hasilnya adalah ratusan halaman berisi analisa desain, termasuk usulan bagaimana desain yang lebih baik untuk setiap masalah desain yang saya temukan. Setelah mendapat respon positif dari hasil analisa tersebut, saya meminta internal transfer untuk menjadi UX Designer, dan Alhamdulillah diterima. Mulailah perjalanan saya sebagai Product Designer di tahun 2009.
Pelajaran penting di tahun pertama
Setelah sebelumnya telah mencapai posisi Lead Software Engineer, di dunia desain saya harus mulai dari nol lagi. Buku-buku bisa membantu untuk membuka pengetahuan, tapi untuk mencapai tahap wisdom, perlu dibarengi dengan pengalaman  menerapkan pengetahuan itu di proyek nyata. Beberapa hal yang menjadi pelajaran penting di tahun pertama sebagai Product Designer:
1.	Terlalu fokus pada design best practices, bukan user needs atau business goals  Desain hanyalah sarana untuk membantu pengguna dan bisnis mencapai tujuan. Karena saya pemula, jadi sangat text-book, dan kurang fleksible saat mencari solusi/mendesain produk.
2.	Tidak kolaboratif  Ini terkait dengan poin pertama. Desain dianggap bagian tim desain saja, padahal proses mencari solusi itu mesti mengikutsertakan semua tim, baik produk, bisnis, operasional, sampai teknologi. Dengan tidak kolaboratif, masing-masing tim jadi memaksakan agenda masing-masing, dan akhirnya pengguna lah yang jadi korban. Mestinya sebagai tim desain, saya bisa memfasilitasi solutioning.
3.	Tidak lean  proses desain bisa mencapai berminggu-minggu, karena mencoba menyempurnakan aspek desain sampai ke detail UI/Visual Design nya, tanpa sadar bahwa proses desain mestinya dibagi ke 3 hal: buat high level flow/experience map, kemudian lanjut ke wireframes (fokus di konten, fitur, dan high level transition), baru detail UI/Visual Design termasuk motion design.
4.	Kurang eksploratif dan iteratif ide-ide desain yang muncul untuk suatu masalah hanya satu-dua saja, paling banyak tiga. Kurang mengerti bahwa di tahap eksplorasi, mestinya digunakan sebagai kesempatan untuk berinovasi (dengan memunculkan banyak  puluhan ratusan ide out-of-the-box), baru setelah tahap eksplorasi, dilakukan tahap pengkerucutan ide menjadi 23 solusi potensial yang mesti di validasi ke pengguna dan di perbaiki (iteratif).
5.	Tidak fleksibel dalam melakukan validasi ke pengguna  validasi konsep, biasanya Usability Testing, memakan waktu berminggu-minggu, dari mulai perencanaan, pelaksanaan, sampai analisa hasil.
6.	Tidak membangun personal relationship dengan tim lain  seprofesional apapun, personal relationship tetap penting. Bukan masalah KKN, tapi dengan hubungan yang baik, komunikasi bisa lebih baik, dan juga kita membangun rasa empati  mengerti aspirasi, prioritas, dan masalah yang dihadapi tim lain.
Belajar, latihan, dan praktek
Bisa dibilang, kebanyakan proyek di tahun-tahun pertama saya sebagai Product Designer, gagal semua. Saya juga gagal merubah mindset kebanyakan orang di perusahaan operator selular tersebut untuk menjadi user-centric. Akhirnya tim desain pun dibubarkan. Satu per satu mulai resign, atau pindah ke divisi lain. Tapi hal ini tidak membuat saya mundur untuk kembali menjadi Mobile Software Engineer. Saat kita punya mimpi atau tujuan yang baik, jangan harap segalanya akan mudah. Everything good is never easy, kata orang bijak. Saya tetap semangat menjadi seorang Product Designer. Makin banyak belajar dan latihan desain, sampai akhirnya ada kesempatan datang untuk hijrah ke Singapura, sebagai UX Designer juga.
Semenjak di Singapura, dunia desain semakin membuat saya bersemangat dan terbuka lebar. Mungkin nanti saya tulis artikel lain tentang pembelajaran di berbagai perusahaan yang pernah saya jalani. Untuk sekarang, semoga tulisan ini bisa menjadi inspirasi untuk siapapun yang ingin berpindah haluan karir, terutama menjadi UX Designer/Product Designer. Kerjakan hal yang membuat kita semangat dan kita sukai, jangan takut atau ragu mulai dari nol untuk mengejar mimpi/cita-cita, belajar dan latihan keras, beri yang terbaik tanpa pamrih, dan serahkan hasilnya kepada Allah.

110,Mengatur Ritme Pekerjaan,1/29/2019,"Masim ""Vavai"" Sugianto",https://medium.com/@vavai/mengatur-ritme-pekerjaan-210b71b59878,"Saat bermain ke Kebumen beberapa waktu yang lalu, kami mampir ke rumah family di daerah Prembun. Daerahnya masih hijau rimbun pepohonan dan dikelilingi sawah dan ladang. Sejuk di pagi dan sore hari, dingin di malam hari, apalagi saat kami kesana saat musim hujan di akhir bulan Desember 2018. Keluarga di Prembun bekerja sebagai petani. Ada ternak ayam dan bebek maupun kolam ikan sebagai selingan. Saat musim tanam dan musim panen tentu bekerja keras. Namun meski bekerja keras sebagaimana petani pada umumnya, ritme pekerjaan mereka berbeda dengan ritme para pekerja di kota. Tentu saja ya.
Maksudnya, ritme pekerjaan petani, meski kelihatannya bekerja lebih keras, ada keseimbangan antara waktu bekerja dengan waktu istirahat. Keseimbangan antara kerja keras dengan bersantai.
Petani umumnya tidak diburu waktu di pagi hari. Masih sempat minum teh atau ngopi dengan cemilan goreng pisang atau rebusan singkong. Jarang yang berangkat ke sawah sehabis Shubuh atau di waktu Shubuh. Waktu Shubuh ya waktunya mandi dan shalat, bukan waktunya berangkat ke sawah.
Pagi bekerja keras, siang beristirahat untuk makan siang dan shalat Dzuhur. Pulang ke rumah menjelang Ashar dan sudah mandi bersiap ke masjid untuk shalat Maghrib. Selepas maghrib sudah bersantai di rumah. Selepas Isya bisa tidur cepat, untuk bangun pagi shalat Shubuh keesokan harinya.
Bandingkan dengan kita yang tinggal di daerah kota metropolitan dan sekitarnya. Kadang bangun Shubuh untuk mengejar keberangkatan kereta. Telat berangkat, keretanya sudah berjubel. Butuh perjuangan ekstra untuk bisa sampai di tujuan.
Pulang ke rumah sudah malam. Itupun kadang masih membawa pekerjaan yang harus diselesaikan. Kita jadi lupa mana waktu dan jam kerja dan mana waktu untuk bersantai.
Sudah berjuang seperti demikian saja, kadang penghasilan masih terasa pas-pasan untuk membiayai kebutuhan hidup. Untuk mencukupinya, kita harus bekerja lebih keras lagi, kadang melebihi ukuran normal.
Jadi sebenarnya, kita yang mengatur pekerjaan atau pekerjaan yang mengatur kita?
Saya menulis hal diatas, karena kesibukan yang demikian sibuk bukan hanya monopoli pekerja kantoran yang ulang-alik ke kota metropolitan saja. Team Excellent yang bekerja di daerah pinggiran di Bekasi atau saya yang menjalani wirausaha saja masih kerap tertelikung pressure pekerjaan.
Saat malam misalnya, kadang kerap tertukar antara hobi dengan pekerjaan. Kadang ada klien yang membutuhkan support justru selepas jam kantor. Jika kebutuhannya urgent dan klien memang berlangganan paket support yang sesuai dengan tingkat responnya, otomatis kebutuhan tersebut ditangani juga. Jika dibiarkan terus menerus, kita jadi lupa pada esensi pekerjaan yang kita lakukan untuk membahagiakan diri kita sendiri.
Mengatur ritme pekerjaan tentu bukan pekerjaan mudah, namun juga bukan berarti lantas kita menyerah pada tekanan tersebut. Langkah terbaik adalah menyiasatinya, agar tetap ada keseimbangan antara waktu untuk pekerjaan dengan waktu untuk kebahagiaan hidup kita dan lingkungan terdekat kita.
Jangan sampai bekerja keras sampai lupa waktu, lupa kesehatan dan lupa pada esensi sebenarnya kita melakukan pekerjaan.","Profesi, Pengalaman Pribadi"
